Sometimes the Angel comes in the form of a man and talks to me and I grasp whatever he says.\" 'Aisha added: Verily I saw the Prophet () being inspired divinely on a very cold day and noticed the sweat dropping from his forehead (as the Inspiration was over).\r\n", "3": "Narrated 'Aisha:\n                       (the mother of the faithful believers) The commencement of the Divine Inspiration to Allah's Messenger () was in the form of good dreams which came true like bright daylight, and then the love of seclusion was bestowed upon him. He used to go in seclusion in the cave of Hira where he used to worship (Allah alone) continuously for many days before his desire to see his family. He used to take with him the journey food for the stay and then come back to (his wife) Khadija to take his food likewise again till suddenly the Truth descended upon him while he was in the cave of Hira. The angel came to him and asked him to read. The Prophet () replied, \"I do not know how to read.\" The Prophet () added, \"The angel caught me (forcefully) and pressed me so hard that I could not bear it any more. He then released me and again asked me to read and I replied, 'I do not know how to read.' Thereupon he caught me again and pressed me a second time till I could not bear it any more. He then released me and again asked me to read but again I replied, 'I do not know how to read (or what shall I read)?' Thereupon he caught me for the third time and pressed me, and then released me and said, 'Read in the name of your Lord, who has created (all that exists), created man from a clot. Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous.\" (96.1, 96.2, 96.3) Then Allah's Messenger () returned with the Inspiration and with his heart beating severely. Then he went to Khadija bint Khuwailid and said, \"Cover me! Cover me!\" They covered him till his fear was over and after that he told her everything that had happened and said, \"I fear that something may happen to me.\" Khadija replied, \"Never! By Allah, Allah will never disgrace you. You keep good relations with your kith and kin, help the poor and the destitute, serve your guests generously and assist the deserving calamity-afflicted ones.\"  Khadija then accompanied him to her cousin Waraqa bin Naufal bin Asad bin 'Abdul 'Uzza, who, during the pre-Islamic Period became a Christian and used to write the writing with Hebrew letters. He would write from the Gospel in Hebrew as much as Allah wished him to write. He was an old man and had lost his eyesight. Khadija said to Waraqa, \"Listen to the story of your nephew, O my cousin!\" Waraqa asked, \"O my nephew! What have you seen?\" Allah's Messenger () described whatever he had seen. Waraqa said, \"This is the same one who keeps the secrets (angel Gabriel) whom Allah had sent to Moses. I wish I were young and could live up to the time when your people would turn you out.\" Allah's Messenger () asked, \"Will they drive me out?\" Waraqa replied in the affirmative and said, \"Anyone (man) who came with something similar to what you have brought was treated with hostility; and if I should remain alive till the day when you will be turned out then I would support you strongly.\" But after a few days Waraqa died and the Divine Inspiration was also paused for a while.", "4": "Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah Al-Ansari (while talking about the period of pause in revelation) reporting the speech of the Prophet:\n                      \"While I was walking, all of a sudden I heard a voice from the sky. I looked up and saw the same angel who had visited me at the cave of Hira' sitting on a chair between the sky and the earth. I got afraid of him and came back home and said, 'Wrap me (in blankets).' And then Allah revealed the following Holy Verses (of Quran):  'O you (i.e. Muhammad)! wrapped up in garments!' Arise and warn (the people against Allah's Punishment),... up to 'and desert the idols.'

It is for Us to collect it and to give you (O Muhammad) the ability to recite it (the Quran)' (75.16-17) which means that Allah will make him (the Prophet) remember the portion of the Qur'an which was revealed at that time by heart and recite it. The statement of Allah: 'And when we have recited it to you (O Muhammad through Gabriel) then you follow its (Quran) recital' (75.18) means 'listen to it and be silent.' Then it is for Us (Allah) to make it clear to you' (75.19) means 'Then it is (for Allah) to make you recite it (and its meaning will be clear by itself through your tongue).

Gabriel used to meet him every night of Ramadan to teach him \n     the Qur'an. Allah's Messenger () was the most generous person, even more \n     generous than the strong uncontrollable wind (in readiness and haste \n     to do charitable deeds).\n", "7": "\n\n     Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas:\n\n\n     Abu Sufyan bin Harb informed me that Heraclius had sent a messenger to\n     him while he had been accompanying a caravan from Quraish. They were \n     merchants doing business in Sham (Syria, Palestine, Lebanon and \n     Jordan), at the time when Allah's Messenger () had truce with Abu Sufyan \n     and Quraish infidels. So Abu Sufyan and his companions went to \n     Heraclius at Ilya (Jerusalem). Heraclius called them in the court and \n     he had all the senior Roman dignitaries around him. He called for his \n     translator who, translating Heraclius's question said to them, \"Who \n     amongst you is closely related to that man who claims to be a \n     Prophet?\" Abu Sufyan replied, \"I am the nearest relative to him \n     (amongst the group).\"\n\n\n     Heraclius said, \"Bring him (Abu Sufyan) close to me and make his \n     companions stand behind him.\" Abu Sufyan added, Heraclius told his \n     translator to tell my companions that he wanted to put some questions \n     to me regarding that man (The Prophet) and that if I told a lie they \n     (my companions) should contradict me.\" Abu Sufyan added, \"By Allah! \n     Had I not been afraid of my companions labeling me a liar, I would not\n     have spoken the truth about the Prophet. The first question he asked \n     me about him was:\n\n\n     'What is his family status amongst you?' \n\n\n     I replied, 'He belongs to a good (noble) family amongst us.' \n\n\n     Heraclius further asked, 'Has anybody amongst you ever claimed the \n     same (i.e. to be a Prophet) before him?'\n\n\n     I replied, 'No.'\n\n\n     He said, 'Was anybody amongst his ancestors a king?'\n\n\n     I replied, 'No.'\n\n\n     Heraclius asked, 'Do the nobles or the poor follow him?'\n\n\n     I replied, 'It is the poor who follow him.'\n\n\n     He said, 'Are his followers increasing decreasing (day by day)?'\n\n\n     I replied, 'They are increasing.'\n\n\n     He then asked, 'Does anybody amongst those who embrace his religion \n     become displeased and renounce the religion afterwards?'\n\n\n     I replied, 'No.'\n\n\n     Heraclius said, 'Have you ever accused him of telling lies before his \n     claim (to be a Prophet)?'\n\n\n     I replied, 'No. '\n\n\n     Heraclius said, 'Does he break his promises?'\n\n\n     I replied, 'No. We are at truce with him but we do not know what he \n     will do in it.' I could not find opportunity to say anything against \n     him except that.\n\n\n     Heraclius asked, 'Have you ever had a war with him?'\n\n\n     I replied, 'Yes.'\n\n\n     Then he said, 'What was the outcome of the battles?'\n\n\n     I replied, 'Sometimes he was victorious and sometimes we.'\n\n\n     Heraclius said, 'What does he order you to do?'\n\n\n     I said, 'He tells us to worship Allah and Allah alone and not to \n     worship anything along with Him, and to renounce all that our \n     ancestors had said. He orders us to pray, to speak the truth, to be \n     chaste and to keep good relations with our Kith and kin.'\n\n\n     Heraclius asked the translator to convey to me the following, I asked \n     you about his family and your reply was that he belonged to a very \n     noble family. In fact all the Apostles come from noble families \n     amongst their respective peoples. I questioned you whether anybody \n     else amongst you claimed such a thing, your reply was in the negative.\n     If the answer had been in the affirmative, I would have thought that \n     this man was following the previous man's statement. Then I asked you \n     whether anyone of his ancestors was a king. Your reply was in the \n     negative, and if it had been in the affirmative, I would have thought \n     that this man wanted to take back his ancestral kingdom.\n\n\n     I further asked whether he was ever accused of telling lies before he \n     said what he said, and your reply was in the negative. So I wondered \n     how a person who does not tell a lie about others could ever tell a \n     lie about Allah. I, then asked you whether the rich people followed \n     him or the poor. You replied that it was the poor who followed him. \n     And in fact all the Apostle have been followed by this very class of \n     people. Then I asked you whether his followers were increasing or \n     decreasing. You replied that they were increasing, and in fact this is\n     the way of true faith, till it is complete in all respects. I further \n     asked you whether there was anybody, who, after embracing his \n     religion, became displeased and discarded his religion. Your reply was\n     in the negative, and in fact this is (the sign of) true faith, when \n     its delight enters the hearts and mixes with them completely. I asked \n     you whether he had ever betrayed. You replied in the negative and \n     likewise the Apostles never betray. Then I asked you what he ordered \n     you to do. You replied that he ordered you to worship Allah and Allah \n     alone and not to worship any thing along with Him and forbade you to \n     worship idols and ordered you to pray, to speak the truth and to be \n     chaste. If what you have said is true, he will very soon occupy this \n     place underneath my feet and I knew it (from the scriptures) that he \n     was going to appear but I did not know that he would be from you, and \n     if I could reach him definitely, I would go immediately to meet him \n     and if I were with him, I would certainly wash his feet.' Heraclius \n     then asked for the letter addressed by Allah's Apostle\n\n\n     which was delivered by Dihya to the Governor of Busra, who forwarded \n     it to Heraclius to read. The contents of the letter were as follows: \n     \"In the name of Allah the Beneficent, the Merciful (This letter is) \n     from Muhammad the slave of Allah and His Apostle to Heraclius the \n     ruler of Byzantine. Peace be upon him, who follows the right path. \n     Furthermore I invite you to Islam, and if you become a Muslim you will\n     be safe, and Allah will double your reward, and if you reject this \n     invitation of Islam you will be committing a sin by misguiding your \n     Arisiyin (peasants). (And I recite to you Allah's Statement:)\n\n\n     'O people of the scripture! Come to a word common to you and us that \n     we worship none but Allah and that we associate nothing in worship \n     with Him, and that none of us shall take others as Lords beside Allah.\n     Then, if they turn away, say: Bear witness that we are Muslims (those \n     who have surrendered to Allah).' (3:64).\n\n\n     Abu Sufyan then added, \"When Heraclius had finished his speech and had\n     read the letter, there was a great hue and cry in the Royal Court. So \n     we were turned out of the court. I told my companions that the \n     question of Ibn-Abi-Kabsha) (the Prophet () Muhammad) has become so \n     prominent that even the King of Bani Al-Asfar (Byzantine) is afraid of\n     him. Then I started to become sure that he (the Prophet) would be the \n     conqueror in the near future till I embraced Islam (i.e. Allah guided \n     me to it).\"\n\n\n     The sub narrator adds, \"Ibn An-Natur was the Governor of llya' \n     (Jerusalem) and Heraclius was the head of the Christians of Sham. Ibn \n     An-Natur narrates that once while Heraclius was visiting ilya' \n     (Jerusalem), he got up in the morning with a sad mood. Some of his \n     priests asked him why he was in that mood? Heraclius was a foreteller \n     and an astrologer. He replied, 'At night when I looked at the stars, I\n     saw that the leader of those who practice circumcision had appeared \n     (become the conqueror). Who are they who practice circumcision?' The \n     people replied, 'Except the Jews nobody practices circumcision, so you\n     should not be afraid of them (Jews).\n\n\n     'Just Issue orders to kill every Jew present in the country.'\n\n\n     While they were discussing it, a messenger sent by the king of Ghassan\n     to convey the news of Allah's Messenger () to Heraclius was brought in. \n     Having heard the news, he (Heraclius) ordered the people to go and see\n     whether the messenger of Ghassan was circumcised. The people, after \n     seeing him, told Heraclius that he was circumcised. Heraclius then \n     asked him about the Arabs. The messenger replied, 'Arabs also practice\n     circumcision.'\n\n\n     (After hearing that) Heraclius remarked that sovereignty of the 'Arabs\n     had appeared. Heraclius then wrote a letter to his friend in Rome who \n     was as good as Heraclius in knowledge. Heraclius then left for Homs. \n     (a town in Syrian and stayed there till he received the reply of his \n     letter from his friend who agreed with him in his opinion about the \n     emergence of the Prophet () and the fact that he was a Prophet. On that \n     Heraclius invited all the heads of the Byzantines to assemble in his \n     palace at Homs. When they assembled, he ordered that all the doors of \n     his palace be closed. Then he came out and said, 'O Byzantines! If \n     success is your desire and if you seek right guidance and want your \n     empire to remain then give a pledge of allegiance to this Prophet \n     (i.e. embrace Islam).'\n\n\n     (On hearing the views of Heraclius) the people ran towards the gates \n     of the palace like onagers but found the doors closed. Heraclius \n     realized their hatred towards Islam and when he lost the hope of their\n     embracing Islam, he ordered that they should be brought back in \n     audience.\n\n\n     (When they returned) he said, 'What already said was just to test the \n     strength of your conviction and I have seen it.' The people prostrated\n     before him and became pleased with him, and this was the end of \n     Heraclius's story (in connection with his faith).\n", "8": "\n\n     Narrated Ibn 'Umar:\n\n\n     Allah's Messenger () said: Islam is based on (the following) five \n     (principles):\n\n\n     1.

We, the \npeople of Quraish, used to have authority over women, but when we came to live with the Ansar, we \nnoticed that the Ansari women had the upper hand over their men, so our women started acquiring the \nhabits of the Ansari women. Once I shouted at my wife and she paid me back in my coin and I \ndisliked that she should answer me back. She said, 'Why do you take it ill that I retort upon you? By \nAllah, the wives of the Prophet () retort upon him, and some of them may not speak with him for the \nwhole day till night.' What she said scared me and I said to her, 'Whoever amongst them does so, will \nbe a great loser.' Then I dressed myself and went to Hafsa and asked her, 'Does any of you keep \nAllah's Messenger () angry all the day long till night?' She replied in the affirmative. I said, 'She is a ruined \nlosing person (and will never have success)! Doesn't she fear that Allah may get angry for the anger of \nAllah's Messenger () and thus she will be ruined? Don't ask Allah's Messenger () too many things, and don't \nretort upon him in any case, and don't desert him. Demand from me whatever you like, and don't be \ntempted to imitate your neighbor (i.e. `Aisha) in her behavior towards the Prophet), for she (i.e. Aisha) \nis more beautiful than you, and more beloved to Allah's Messenger (). \nIn those days it was rumored that Ghassan, (a tribe living in Sham) was getting prepared their horses \nto invade us.

He replied that it was worse and more serious than that, and added that Allah's \nApostle had divorced all his wives. I said, Hafsa is a ruined loser! I expected that would happen some \nday.' So I dressed myself and offered the Fajr prayer with the Prophet. Then the Prophet () entered an \nupper room and stayed there alone. I went to Hafsa and found her weeping. I asked her, 'Why are you \nweeping? Didn't I warn you? Have Allah's Messenger () divorced you all?' She replied, 'I don't know. He is \nthere in the upper room.' I then went out and came to the pulpit and found a group of people around it \nand some of them were weeping. \nThen I sat with them for some time, but could not endure the situation. So I went to the upper room \nwhere the Prophet () was and requested to a black slave of his: \"Will you get the permission of (Allah's \nApostle) for `Umar (to enter)? The slave went in, talked to the Prophet () about it and came out saying, 'I \nmentioned you to him but he did not reply.' So, I went and sat with the people who were sitting by the \npulpit, but I could not bear the situation, so I went to the slave again and said: \"Will you get he \npermission for `Umar? He went in and brought the same reply as before. When I was leaving, behold, \nthe slave called me saying, \"Allah's Messenger () has granted you permission.\" So, I entered upon the \nProphet and saw him lying on a mat without wedding on it, and the mat had left its mark on the body \nof the Prophet, and he was leaning on a leather pillow stuffed with palm fires.

I said (to Allah's Messenger ()) \"Invoke Allah to make your followers prosperous for the \nPersians and the Byzantines have been made prosperous and given worldly luxuries, though they do \nnot worship Allah?' The Prophet () was leaning then (and on hearing my speech he sat straight) and said, \n'O Ibn Al-Khattab! Do you have any doubt (that the Hereafter is better than this world)? These people \nhave been given rewards of their good deeds in this world only.' I asked the Prophet () .

That month consisted of twenty-nine \ndays. `Aisha said, 'When the Divine revelation of Choice was revealed, the Prophet () started with me, \nsaying to me, 'I am telling you something, but you need not hurry to give the reply till you can consult \nyour parents.\" `Aisha knew that her parents would not advise her to part with the Prophet () . \nThe Prophet () said that Allah had said: 'O Prophet!

When the order of setting off was \ngiven, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the \ncamp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. \nSo, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the \ncamel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that \ntime, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did \nnot feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. \nAt that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace \nafter the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used \nto stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that \nstate, I felt sleepy and slept. \nSafwan bin Mu'attal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the \nmorning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I \ngot up when I heard him saying, \"Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will \nreturn to Him).\" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the \nfront legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by \nthe rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for \ndestruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers \nwas `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month \nwhile the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my \nailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet () which I used to receive from \nhim when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, 'How is that (girl)?' I did not know anything \nof what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi \nwhere we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except \nfrom night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours \nwas similar to the habit of the old 'Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um \nMistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she \nsaid, 'Let Mistah be ruined.' I said, 'You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took \npart in (the battle of) Badr?' She said, 'O Hanata (you there) didn't you hear what they said?' Then she \ntold me the rumors of the false accusers. \nMy sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allah's Messenger () came to me, and after \ngreeting he said, 'How is that (girl)?' I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to \nbe sure of the news through them I Allah's Messenger () allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked \nmy mother, 'What are the people talking about?' She said, 'O my daughter! Don't worry much about \nthis matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, \nbut the women would forge false news about her.' I said, 'Glorified be Allah! Are the people really \ntaking of this matter?' That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning \nAllah's Messenger () called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration \ndelayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of \nthe good reputation of his wives and added, 'O Allah's Messenger ()! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we \nknow nothing about her but good.' `Ali bin Abu Talib said, 'O Allah's Messenger ()! Allah has no imposed \nrestrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant \nwho will tell you the truth.' On that Allah's Messenger () called Buraira and said, 'O Burair. Did you ever \nsee anything which roused your suspicions about her?' Buraira said, 'No, by Allah Who has sent you \nwith the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who \nsometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat.' On that day Allah's Messenger () ascended the \npulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allah's \nApostle said, 'Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt \nme by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, \nand they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my \nhouse except in my company.' \nSa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, 'O Allah's Messenger ()! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that \nman is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the \nKhazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order.' On that Sa`d bin 'Ubada, the chief of the \nKhazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe \nand said, 'By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him.' \nOn that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin 'Ubada), 'By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, \nwe will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites.' On this the two tribes of Aus and \nKhazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allah's Messenger () was standing on the \npulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on \nweeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. \nIn the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my \nliver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari \nwoman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping \nwith me. While we were in this state, Allah's Messenger () came and sat down and he had never sat with me \nsince the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. \nHe recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His \nApostle) and then said, 'O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, \nthen Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and \nask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah \naccepts his repentance.' When Allah's Messenger () finished his speech my tears ceased completely and \nthere remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allah's Messenger () on my \nbehalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah's Messenger ().' I said to my mother, \n'Talk to Allah's Messenger () on my behalf.' She said, 'By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah's \nApostle. \nI was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Qur'an. I said. 'I know, by Allah, that you \nhave listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it \nas a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not \nbelieve me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you \nwould believe me. By Allah, I don't compare my situation with you except to the situation of Joseph's \nfather (i.e. Jacob) who said, 'So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is \nAllah (Alone) whose help can be sought.' Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah \nwould prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in \nmy case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Qur'an. I had hoped that \nAllah's Messenger () might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allah's \nApostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allah's \nApostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on \nbeing inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like \npearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allah's Messenger () was over, he was smiling \nand the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence.' My mother \ntold me to go to Allah's Messenger () . I replied, 'By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah.' \nSo Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .\" (24.11) \nWhen Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin \nUthatha for he was his relative, said, 'By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of \nwhat he said about Aisha.' But Allah later revealed: -- \n\"And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in \nneed and those who left their homes in Allah's Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish \nthat Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) After that Abu \nBakr said, 'Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me,' and resumed helping Mistah whom he \nused to help before. \nAllah's Messenger () also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophet's wife about me saying, 'What do you \nknow and what did you see?'

The Prophet () changed his way till he \ndismounted at the farthest end of Al-Hudaibiya at a pit (i.e. well) containing a little water which the \npeople used in small amounts, and in a short while the people used up all its water and complained to \nAllah's Messenger (); of thirst. The Prophet () took an arrow out of his arrow-case and ordered them to put the \narrow in that pit. By Allah, the water started and continued sprouting out till all the people quenched \ntheir thirst and returned with satisfaction. While they were still in that state, Budail bin Warqa-al- \nKhuza`i came with some persons from his tribe Khuza`a and they were the advisers of Allah's Messenger () \nwho would keep no secret from him and were from the people of Tihama.

But if \nthey do not accept the truce, by Allah in Whose Hands my life is, I will fight with them defending my \nCause till I get killed, but (I am sure) Allah will definitely make His Cause victorious.\" Budail said, \"I \nwill inform them of what you have said.\" So, he set off till he reached Quraish and said, \"We have \ncome from that man (i.e. Muhammad) whom we heard saying something which we will disclose to \nyou if you should like.\" Some of the fools among Quraish shouted that they were not in need of this \ninformation, but the wiser among them said, \"Relate what you heard him saying.\" Budail said, \"I \nheard him saying so-and-so,\" relating what the Prophet () had told him. \n`Urwa bin Mas`ud got up and said, \"O people! Aren't you the sons? They said, \"Yes.\" He added, \"Am \nI not the father?\" They said, \"Yes.\" He said, \"Do you mistrust me?\" They said, \"No.\" He said, \"Don't \nyou know that I invited the people of `Ukaz for your help, and when they refused I brought my \nrelatives and children and those who obeyed me (to help you)?\" They said, \"Yes.\" He said, \"Well, this \nman (i.e. the Prophet) has offered you a reasonable proposal, you'd better accept it and allow me to \nmeet him.\" They said, \"You may meet him.\" So, he went to the Prophet () and started talking to him. \nThe Prophet () told him almost the same as he had told Budail. Then `Urwa said, \"O Muhammad! Won't \nyou feel any scruple in extirpating your relations? Have you ever heard of anyone amongst the Arabs \nextirpating his relatives before you? On the other hand, if the reverse should happen, (nobody will aid \nyou, for) by Allah, I do not see (with you) dignified people, but people from various tribes who would \nrun away leaving you alone.\" Hearing that, Abu Bakr abused him and said, \"Do you say we would run \nand leave the Prophet () alone?\" `Urwa said, \"Who is that man?\" They said, \"He is Abu Bakr.\" `Urwa \nsaid to Abu Bakr, \"By Him in Whose Hands my life is, were it not for the favor which you did to me \nand which I did not compensate, I would retort on you.\" `Urwa kept on talking to the Prophet () and \nseizing the Prophet's beard as he was talking while Al-Mughira bin Shu`ba was standing near the head \nof the Prophet, holding a sword and wearing a helmet. Whenever `Urwa stretched his hand towards \nthe beard of the Prophet, Al-Mughira would hit his hand with the handle of the sword and say (to \n`Urwa), \"Remove your hand from the beard of Allah's Messenger ().\" `Urwa raised his head and asked, \n\"Who is that?\" The people said, \"He is Al-Mughira bin Shu`ba.\" `Urwa said, \"O treacherous! Am I not \ndoing my best to prevent evil consequences of your treachery?\" \nBefore embracing Islam Al-Mughira was in the company of some people. He killed them and took \ntheir property and came (to Medina) to embrace Islam. The Prophet () said (to him, \"As regards your \nIslam, I accept it, but as for the property I do not take anything of it. (As it was taken through treason). \n`Urwa then started looking at the Companions of the Prophet. By Allah, whenever Allah's Messenger () \nspat, the spittle would fall in the hand of one of them (i.e. the Prophet's companions) who would rub it \non his face and skin; if he ordered them they would carry his orders immediately; if he performed \nablution, they would struggle to take the remaining water; and when they spoke to him, they would \nlower their voices and would not look at his face constantly out of respect. `Urwa returned to his \npeople and said, \"O people! By Allah, I have been to the kings and to Caesar, Khosrau and An- \nNajashi, yet I have never seen any of them respected by his courtiers as much as Muhammad is \nrespected by his companions. \nBy Allah, if he spat, the spittle would fall in the hand of one of them (i.e. the Prophet's companions) \nwho would rub it on his face and skin; if he ordered them, they would carry out his order immediately; \nif he performed ablution, they would struggle to take the remaining water; and when they spoke, they \nwould lower their voices and would not look at his face constantly out of respect.\" `Urwa added, \"No \ndoubt, he has presented to you a good reasonable offer, so please accept it.\" A man from the tribe of \nBani Kinana said, \"Allow me to go to him,\" and they allowed him, and when he approached the \nProphet and his companions, Allah's Messenger () said, \"He is so-and-so who belongs to the tribe that \nrespects the Budn (i.e. camels of the sacrifice). \nSo, bring the Budn in front of him.\" So, the Budn were brought before him and the people received \nhim while they were reciting Talbiya. When he saw that scene, he said, \"Glorified be Allah! It is not \nfair to prevent these people from visiting the Ka`ba.\" When he returned to his people, he said, 'I saw \nthe Budn garlanded (with colored knotted ropes) and marked (with stabs on their backs). I do not think \nit is advisable to prevent them from visiting the Ka`ba.\" Another person called Mikraz bin Hafs got up \nand sought their permission to go to Muhammad, and they allowed him, too. When he approached the \nMuslims, the Prophet () said, \"Here is Mikraz and he is a vicious man.\" Mikraz started talking to the \nProphet and as he was talking, Suhail bin `Amr came. \nWhen Suhail bin `Amr came, the Prophet () said, \"Now the matter has become easy.\" Suhail said to the \nProphet \"Please conclude a peace treaty with us.\" So, the Prophet () called the clerk and said to him, \n\"Write: By the Name of Allah, the most Beneficent, the most Merciful.\" Suhail said, \"As for \n'Beneficent,' by Allah, I do not know what it means. So write: By Your Name O Allah, as you used to \nwrite previously.\" The Muslims said, \"By Allah, we will not write except: By the Name of Allah, the \nmost Beneficent, the most Merciful.\" The Prophet () said, \"Write: By Your Name O Allah.\" Then he \ndictated, \"This is the peace treaty which Muhammad, Allah's Messenger () has concluded.\" Suhail said, \"By \nAllah, if we knew that you are Allah's Messenger () we would not prevent you from visiting the Ka`ba, and \nwould not fight with you. So, write: \"Muhammad bin `Abdullah.\" The Prophet () said, \"By Allah! I am \nApostle of Allah even if you people do not believe me. Write: Muhammad bin `Abdullah.\" \n(Az-Zuhri said, \"The Prophet () accepted all those things, as he had already said that he would accept \neverything they would demand if it respects the ordinance of Allah, (i.e. by letting him and his \ncompanions perform `Umra.)\" The Prophet () said to Suhail, \"On the condition that you allow us to visit \nthe House (i.e. Ka`ba) so that we may perform Tawaf around it.\" Suhail said, \"By Allah, we will not \n(allow you this year) so as not to give chance to the 'Arabs to say that we have yielded to you, but we \nwill allow you next year.\" So, the Prophet () got that written. \nThen Suhail said, \"We also stipulate that you should return to us whoever comes to you from us, even \nif he embraced your religion.\" The Muslims said, \"Glorified be Allah! How will such a person be \nreturned to the pagans after he has become a Muslim? While they were in this state Abu- Jandal bin \nSuhail bin `Amr came from the valley of Mecca staggering with his fetters and fell down amongst the \nMuslims. Suhail said, \"O Muhammad! This is the very first term with which we make peace with you, \ni.e. you shall return Abu Jandal to me.\" The Prophet () said, \"The peace treaty has not been written yet.\" \nSuhail said, \"I will never allow you to keep him.\" The Prophet () said, \"Yes, do.\" He said, \"I won't do.: \nMikraz said, \"We allow you (to keep him).\" Abu Jandal said, \"O Muslims! Will I be returned to the \npagans though I have come as a Muslim? Don't you see how much I have suffered?\" \n(continued...) \n(continuing... 1): -3.891:... ... \nAbu Jandal had been tortured severely for the Cause of Allah. `Umar bin Al-Khattab said, \"I went to \nthe Prophet () and said, 'Aren't you truly the Apostle of Allah?' The Prophet () said, 'Yes, indeed.' I said, \n'Isn't our Cause just and the cause of the enemy unjust?' He said, 'Yes.' I said, 'Then why should we be \nhumble in our religion?' He said, 'I am Allah's Messenger () and I do not disobey Him, and He will make \nme victorious.' I said, 'Didn't you tell us that we would go to the Ka`ba and perform Tawaf around it?' \nHe said, 'Yes, but did I tell you that we would visit the Ka`ba this year?' I said, 'No.' He said, 'So you \nwill visit it and perform Tawaf around it?' \" `Umar further said, \"I went to Abu Bakr and said, 'O Abu \nBakr! Isn't he truly Allah's Prophet?' He replied, 'Yes.' I said, 'Then why should we be humble in our \nreligion?' He said, 'Indeed, he is Allah's Messenger () and he does not disobey his Lord, and He will make \nhim victorious. Adhere to him as, by Allah, he is on the right.' I said, 'Was he not telling us that we \nwould go to the Ka`ba and perform Tawaf around it?' He said, 'Yes, but did he tell you that you would \ngo to the Ka`ba this year?' I said, 'No.' He said, \"You will go to Ka`ba and perform Tawaf around it.\" \n(Az-Zuhri said, \" `Umar said, 'I performed many good deeds as expiation for the improper questions I \nasked them.' \") \nWhen the writing of the peace treaty was concluded, Allah's Messenger () said to his companions, \"Get up \nand' slaughter your sacrifices and get your head shaved.\" By Allah none of them got up, and the \nProphet repeated his order thrice. When none of them got up, he left them and went to Um Salama and \ntold her of the people's attitudes towards him. Um Salama said, \"O the Prophet () of Allah! Do you want \nyour order to be carried out? Go out and don't say a word to anybody till you have slaughtered your \nsacrifice and call your barber to shave your head.\" So, the Prophet () went out and did not talk to anyone \nof them till he did that, i.e. slaughtered the sacrifice and called his barber who shaved his head. Seeing \nthat, the companions of the Prophet () got up, slaughtered their sacrifices, and started shaving the heads \nof one another, and there was so much rush that there was a danger of killing each other. Then some \nbelieving women came (to the Prophet () ); and Allah revealed the following Divine Verses:-- \n\"O you who believe, when the believing women come to you as emigrants examine them . . .\" (60.10) \n`Umar then divorced two wives of his who were infidels. Later on Muawiya bin Abu Sufyan married \none of them, and Safwan bin Umaiya married the other. When the Prophet () returned to Medina, Abu \nBasir, a new Muslim convert from Quraish came to him. The Infidels sent in his pursuit two men who \nsaid (to the Prophet () ), \"Abide by the promise you gave us.\" So, the Prophet () handed him over to them. \nThey took him out (of the City) till they reached Dhul-Hulaifa where they dismounted to eat some \ndates they had with them. Abu Basir said to one of them, \"By Allah, O so-and-so, I see you have a \nfine sword.\" The other drew it out (of the scabbard) and said, \"By Allah, it is very fine and I have tried \nit many times.\" Abu Basir said, \"Let me have a look at it.\" \nWhen the other gave it to him, he hit him with it till he died, and his companion ran away till he came \nto Medina and entered the Mosque running. When Allah's Messenger () saw him he said, \"This man \nappears to have been frightened.\" When he reached the Prophet () he said, \"My companion has been \nmurdered and I would have been murdered too.\" Abu Basir came and said, \"O Allah's Messenger (), by \nAllah, Allah has made you fulfill your obligations by your returning me to them (i.e. the Infidels), but \nAllah has saved me from them.\" The Prophet () said, \"Woe to his mother! what excellent war kindler he \nwould be, should he only have supporters.\" When Abu Basir heard that he understood that the Prophet () \nwould return him to them again, so he set off till he reached the seashore. Abu Jandal bin Suhail got \nhimself released from them (i.e. infidels) and joined Abu Basir. So, whenever a man from Quraish \nembraced Islam he would follow Abu Basir till they formed a strong group. By Allah, whenever they \nheard about a caravan of Quraish heading towards Sham, they stopped it and attacked and killed them \n(i.e. infidels) and took their properties. The people of Quraish sent a message to the Prophet () \nrequesting him for the Sake of Allah and Kith and kin to send for (i.e. Abu Basir and his companions) \npromising that whoever (amongst them) came to the Prophet () would be secure. So the Prophet () sent for \nthem (i.e. Abu Basir's companions) and Allah I revealed the following Divine Verses: \n\"And it is He Who Has withheld their hands from you and your hands From them in the midst of \nMecca, After He made you the victorious over them. ... the unbelievers had pride and haughtiness, in \ntheir hearts ... the pride and haughtiness of the time of ignorance.\" (48.24-26) And their pride and \nhaughtiness was that they did not confess (write in the treaty) that he (i.e. Muhammad) was the \nProphet of Allah and refused to write: \"In the Name of Allah, the most Beneficent, the Most \nMerciful,\" and they (the mushriks) prevented them (the Muslims) from visiting the House (the Ka`bah).", "2628": " Narrated Az-Zuhri:\n`Urwa said, \"Aisha told me that Allah's Messenger () used to examine the women \nemigrants. We have been told also that when Allah revealed the order that the Muslims should return \nto the pagans what they had spent on their wives who emigrated (after embracing Islam) and that the \nMushriks should not. keep unbelieving women as their wives, `Umar divorced two of his wives, \nQariba, the daughter of Abu Urhaiya and the daughter of Jarwal Al-Khuza`i. Later on Mu'awiya \nmarried Qariba and Abu Jahm married the other.\" \nWhen the pagans refused to pay what the Muslims had spent on their wives, Allah revealed: \"And if \nany of your wives have gone from you to the unbelievers and you have an accession (By the coming \nover of a woman from the other side) (Then pay to those whose wives have gone) The equivalent of \nwhat they had spent (On their Mahr).\" (60.11) \nSo, Allah ordered that the Muslim whose wife, has gone, should be given, as a compensation of the \nMahr he had given to his wife, from the Mahr of the wives of the pagans who had emigrated deserting \ntheir husbands. \nWe do not know any of the women emigrants who deserted Islam after embracing it.

They sent one or two messengers who \ndiscovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the water. So, they all came (towards \nthe water).\" The Prophet () added, \"Ishmael's mother was sitting near the water.

When he asked Ishmael's wife about him, she \nreplied, 'He has gone in search of our livelihood.' Then he asked her about their way of living and their \ncondition, and she replied, 'We are living in misery; we are living in hardship and destitution,' \ncomplaining to him. He said, 'When your husband returns, convey my salutation to him and tell him to \nchange the threshold of the gate (of his house).' When Ishmael came, he seemed to have felt \nsomething unusual, so he asked his wife, 'Has anyone visited you?' She replied, 'Yes, an old man of \nso-and-so description came and asked me about you and I informed him, and he asked about our state \nof living, and I told him that we were living in a hardship and poverty.' On that Ishmael said, 'Did he \nadvise you anything?' She replied, 'Yes, he told me to convey his salutation to you and to tell you to \nchange the threshold of your gate.' Ishmael said, 'It was my father, and he has ordered me to divorce \nyou. Go back to your family.' So, Ishmael divorced her and married another woman from amongst \nthem (i.e. Jurhum). \nThen Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished and called on them again \nbut did not find Ishmael. So he came to Ishmael's wife and asked her about Ishmael. She said, 'He has \ngone in search of our livelihood.' Abraham asked her, 'How are you getting on?' asking her about their \nsustenance and living. She replied, 'We are prosperous and well-off (i.e. we have everything in \nabundance).' Then she thanked Allah' Abraham said, 'What kind of food do you eat?' She said. 'Meat.' \nHe said, 'What do you drink?' She said, 'Water.\" He said, \"O Allah! Bless their meat and water.\" The \nProphet added, \"At that time they did not have grain, and if they had grain, he would have also \ninvoked Allah to bless it.\" The Prophet () added, \"If somebody has only these two things as his \nsustenance, his health and disposition will be badly affected, unless he lives in Mecca.\" The Prophet () \nadded,\" Then Abraham said Ishmael's wife, \"When your husband comes, give my regards to him and \ntell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his gate.' When Ishmael came back, he asked his \nwife, 'Did anyone call on you?' She replied, 'Yes, a good-looking old man came to me,' so she praised \nhim and added. 'He asked about you, and I informed him, and he asked about our livelihood and I told \nhim that we were in a good condition.' Ishmael asked her, 'Did he give you any piece of advice?' She \nsaid, 'Yes, he told me to give his regards to you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of \nyour gate.' On that Ishmael said, 'It was my father, and you are the threshold (of the gate). He has \nordered me to keep you with me.' \nThen Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished, and called on them \nafterwards. He saw Ishmael under a tree near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows. When he saw \nAbraham, he rose up to welcome him (and they greeted each other as a father does with his son or a \nson does with his father). Abraham said, 'O Ishmael! Allah has given me an order.' Ishmael said, 'Do \nwhat your Lord has ordered you to do.' Abraham asked, 'Will you help me?' Ishmael said, 'I will help \nyou.' Abraham said, Allah has ordered me to build a house here,' pointing to a hillock higher than the \nland surrounding it.\" The Prophet () added, \"Then they raised the foundations of the House (i.e. the \nKa`ba). Ishmael brought the stones and Abraham was building, and when the walls became high, \nIshmael brought this stone and put it for Abraham who stood over it and carried on building, while \nIshmael was handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, 'O our Lord! Accept (this service) \nfrom us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.' The Prophet () added, \"Then both of them \nwent on building and going round the Ka`ba saying: O our Lord ! Accept (this service) from us, \nVerily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.\" (2.127)", "3239": "\nNarrated Ibn `Abbas:\nWhen Abraham had differences with his wife), (because of her jealousy of Hajar, Ishmael's mother), \nhe took Ishmael and his mother and went away. They had a water-skin with them containing some \nwater, Ishmael's mother used to drink water from the water-skin so that her milk would increase for \nher child. When Abraham reached Mecca, he made her sit under a tree and afterwards returned home. \nIshmael's mother followed him, and when they reached Kada', she called him from behind, 'O \nAbraham! To whom are you leaving us?' He replied, '(I am leaving you) to Allah's (Care).' \nShe said, 'I am satisfied to be with Allah.' She returned to her place and started drinking water from \nthe water-skin, and her milk increased for her child. When the water had all been used up, she said to \nherself, 'I'd better go and look so that I may see somebody.' She ascended the Safa mountain and \nlooked, hoping to see somebody, but in vain. When she came down to the valley, she ran till she \nreached the Marwa mountain. She ran to and fro (between the two mountains) many times. They she \nsaid to herself, 'i'd better go and see the state of the child,' she went and found it in a state of one on \nthe point of dying. She could not endure to watch it dying and said (to herself), 'If I go and look, I may \nfind somebody.' \nShe went and ascended the Safa mountain and looked for a long while but could not find anybody. \nThus she completed seven rounds (of running) between Safa and Marwa. Again she said (to herself), \n'I'd better go back and see the state of the child.' But suddenly she heard a voice, and she said to that \nstrange voice, 'Help us if you can offer any help.' Lo! It was Gabriel (who had made the voice). \nGabriel hit the earth with his heel like this (Ibn `Abbas hit the earth with his heel to Illustrate it), and \nso the water gushed out. Ishmael's mother was astonished and started digging. (Abu Al-Qasim) (i.e. \nthe Prophet) said, \"If she had left the water, (flow naturally without her intervention), it would have \nbeen flowing on the surface of the earth.\") Ishmael's mother started drinking from the water and her \nmilk increased for her child . Afterwards some people of the tribe of Jurhum, while passing through \nthe bottom of the valley, saw some birds, and that astonished them, and they said, 'Birds can only be \nfound at a place where there is water.' \nThey sent a messenger who searched the place and found the water, and returned to inform them about \nit. Then they all went to her and said, 'O ishmael's mother! Will you allow us to be with you (or dwell \nwith you)?' (And thus they stayed there.) Later on her boy reached the age of puberty and married a \nlady from them. Then an idea occurred to Abraham which he disclosed to his wife (Sarah), 'I want to \ncall on my dependents I left (at Mecca).' When he went there, he greeted (Ishmael's wife) and said, \n'Where is Ishmael?' She replied, 'He has gone out hunting.' Abraham said (to her), 'When he comes, \ntell him to change the threshold of his gate.' When he came, she told him the same whereupon Ishmael \nsaid to her, 'You are the threshold, so go to your family (i.e. you are divorced).' Again Abraham \nthought of visiting his dependents whom he had left (at Mecca), and he told his wife (Sarah) of his \nintentions. \nAbraham came to Ishmael's house and asked. \"Where is Ishmael?\" Ishmael's wife replied, \"He has \ngone out hunting,\" and added, \"Will you stay (for some time) and have something to eat and drink?' \nAbraham asked, 'What is your food and what is your drink?' She replied, 'Our food is meat and our \ndrink is water.' He said, 'O Allah! Bless their meals and their drink.\" Abu Al-Qa-sim (i.e. Prophet) \nsaid, \"Because of Abraham's invocation there are blessings (in Mecca).\" Once more Abraham thought \nof visiting his family he had left (at Mecca), so he told his wife (Sarah) of his decision. He went and \nfound Ishmael behind the Zamzam well, mending his arrows. He said, \"O Ishmael, Your Lord has \nordered me to build a house for Him.\" Ishmael said, \"Obey (the order of) your Lord.\" \nAbraham said, \"Allah has also ordered me that you should help me therein.\" Ishmael said, \"Then I will \ndo.\" So, both of them rose and Abraham started building (the Ka`ba) while Ishmael went on handing \nhim the stones, and both of them were saying, \"O our Lord ! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, \nYou are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.\" (2.127). When the building became high and the old man \n(i.e. Abraham) could no longer lift the stones (to such a high position), he stood over the stone of Al- \nMaqam and Ishmael carried on handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, 'O our Lord! \nAccept (this service) from us, Verily You are All-Hearing, All-Knowing.\" (2.127)", "3240": "\nNarrated Abu Dhar:\nI said, \"O Allah's Messenger ()!

So there was a path for the fish and that astonished them. Moses said, 'That was what \nwe were seeking after.'

Moses greeted him and he replied saying, 'How \ndo people greet each other in your land?' Moses said, 'I am Moses.' The man asked, 'Moses of Bani \nIsrael?'

My knowledge and your knowledge have not decreased Allah's \nKnowledge except as much as this sparrow has decreased the water of the sea with its beak.' Then \nsuddenly Al-Khadir took an adze and plucked a plank, and Moses did not notice it till he had plucked \na plank with the adze. Moses said to him, 'What have you done? They took us on board charging us \nnothing; yet you I have intentionally made a hole in their boat so as to drown its passengers. Verily, \nyou have done a dreadful thing.' Al-Khadir replied, 'Did I not tell you that you would not be able to \nremain patient with me?' Moses replied, 'Do not blame me for what I have forgotten, and do not be \nhard upon me for my fault.'

When the Muslims were put to test (i.e. troubled by the pagans), Abu Bakr set out migrating to the land of Ethiopia, and when he reached Bark-al-Ghimad, Ibn Ad-Daghina, the chief of the tribe of Qara, met him and said, \"O Abu Bakr! Where are you going?\" Abu Bakr replied, \"My people have turned me out (of my country), so I want to wander on the earth and worship my Lord.\" Ibn Ad-Daghina said, \"O Abu Bakr! A man like you should not leave his home-land, nor should he be driven out, because you help the destitute, earn their livings, and you keep good relations with your Kith and kin, help the weak and poor, entertain guests generously, and help the calamity-stricken persons. Therefore I am your protector. Go back and worship your Lord in your town.\" \n\n \n\n  So Abu Bakr returned and Ibn Ad-Daghina accompanied him. In the evening Ibn Ad-Daghina visited the nobles of Quraish and said to them. \"A man like Abu Bakr should not leave his homeland, nor should he be driven out. Do you (i.e. Quraish) drive out a man who helps the destitute, earns their living, keeps good relations with his Kith and kin, helps the weak and poor, entertains guests generously and helps the calamity-stricken persons?\" So the people of Quraish could not refuse Ibn Ad-Daghina's protection, and they said to Ibn Ad-Daghina, \"Let Abu Bakr worship his Lord in his house. He can pray and recite there whatever he likes, but he should not hurt us with it, and should not do it publicly, because we are afraid that he may affect our women and children.\" Ibn Ad-Daghina told Abu Bakr of all that. Abu Bakr stayed in that state, worshipping his Lord in his house. He did not pray publicly, nor did he recite Quran outside his house.  Then a thought occurred to Abu Bakr to build a mosque in front of his house, and there he used to pray and recite the Quran. The women and children of the pagans began to gather around him in great number. They used to wonder at him and look at him. Abu Bakr was a man who used to weep too much, and he could not help weeping on reciting the Quran. That situation scared the nobles of the pagans of Quraish, so they sent for Ibn Ad-Daghina. When he came to them, they said, \"We accepted your protection of Abu Bakr on condition that he should worship his Lord in his house, but he has violated the conditions and he has built a mosque in front of his house where he prays and recites the Quran publicly. We are now afraid that he may affect our women and children unfavorably. So, prevent him from that. If he likes to confine the worship of his Lord to his house, he may do so, but if he insists on doing that openly, ask him to release you from your obligation to protect him, for we dislike to break our pact with you, but we deny Abu Bakr the right to announce his act publicly.\" Ibn Ad-Daghina went to Abu- Bakr and said, (\"O Abu Bakr!) You know well what contract I have made on your behalf; now, you are either to abide by it, or else release me from my obligation of protecting you, because I do not want the 'Arabs hear that my people have dishonored a contract I have made on behalf of another man.\" Abu Bakr replied, \"I release you from your pact to protect me, and am pleased with the protection from Allah.\" \n\n \n\n   At that time the Prophet () was in Mecca, and he said to the Muslims, \"In a dream I have been shown your migration place, a land of date palm trees, between two mountains, the two stony tracts.\" So, some people migrated to Medina, and most of those people who had previously migrated to the land of Ethiopia, returned to Medina. Abu Bakr also prepared to leave for Medina, but Allah's Messenger () said to him, \"Wait for a while, because I hope that I will be allowed to migrate also.\" Abu Bakr said, \"Do you indeed expect this? Let my father be sacrificed for you!\" The Prophet () said, \"Yes.\" So Abu Bakr did not migrate for the sake of Allah's Messenger () in order to accompany him. He fed two she-camels he possessed with the leaves of As-Samur tree that fell on being struck by a stick for four months. \n\n \n\n   One day, while we were sitting in Abu Bakr's house at noon, someone said to Abu Bakr, \"This is Allah's Messenger () with his head covered coming at a time at which he never used to visit us before.\" Abu Bakr said, \"May my parents be sacrificed for him. By Allah, he has not come at this hour except for a great necessity.\" So Allah's Messenger () came and asked permission to enter, and he was allowed to enter. When he entered, he said to Abu Bakr. \"Tell everyone who is present with you to go away.\" Abu Bakr replied, \"There are none but your family. May my father be sacrificed for you, O Allah's Messenger ()!\" The Prophet () said, \"i have been given permission to migrate.\" Abu Bakr said, \"Shall I accompany you? May my father be sacrificed for you, O Allah's Messenger ()!\" Allah's Messenger () said, \"Yes.\" Abu Bakr said, \"O Allah's Messenger ()! May my father be sacrificed for you, take one of these two she-camels of mine.\" Allah's Messenger () replied, \"(I will accept it) with payment.\" So we prepared the baggage quickly and put some journey food in a leather bag for them. Asma, Abu Bakr's daughter, cut a piece from her waist belt and tied the mouth of the leather bag with it, and for that reason she was named Dhat-un-Nitaqain (i.e. the owner of two belts). \n\n \n\n   Then Allah's Messenger () and Abu Bakr reached a cave on the mountain of Thaur and stayed there for three nights. 'Abdullah bin Abi Bakr who was intelligent and a sagacious youth, used to stay (with them) aver night. He used to leave them before day break so that in the morning he would be with Quraish as if he had spent the night in Mecca. He would keep in mind any plot made against them, and when it became dark he would (go and) inform them of it. 'Amir bin Fuhaira, the freed slave of Abu Bakr, used to bring the milch sheep (of his master, Abu Bakr) to them a little while after nightfall in order to rest the sheep there. So they always had fresh milk at night, the milk of their sheep, and the milk which they warmed by throwing heated stones in it. 'Amir bin Fuhaira would then call the herd away when it was still dark (before daybreak). He did the same in each of those three nights. Allah's Messenger () and Abu Bakr had hired a man from the tribe of Bani Ad-Dail from the family of Bani Abd bin Adi as an expert guide, and he was in alliance with the family of Al-'As bin Wail As-Sahmi and he was on the religion of the infidels of Quraish. The Prophet () and Abu Bakr trusted him and gave him their two she-camels and took his promise to bring their two she camels to the cave of the mountain of Thaur in the morning after three nights later. And (when they set out), 'Amir bin Fuhaira and the guide went along with them and the guide led them along the sea-shore.", "3754": " \n\n   The nephew of Suraqa bin Ju'sham said that his father informed him that he heard Suraqa bin Ju'sham saying, \"The messengers of the heathens of Quraish came to us declaring that they had assigned for the persons why would kill or arrest Allah's Messenger () and Abu Bakr, a reward equal to their bloodmoney.

No doubt, I have just seen some people far away on the seashore, and I think they are Muhammad and his companions.\" Suraqa added, \"I too realized that it must have been they. But I said 'No, it is not they, but you have seen so-and-so, and so-and-so whom we saw set out.' I stayed in the gathering for a while and then got up and left for my home. and ordered my slave-girl to get my horse which was behind a hillock, and keep it ready for me. \n\n \n\n   Then I took my spear and left by the back door of my house dragging the lower end of the spear on the ground and keeping it low. Then I reached my horse, mounted it and made it gallop. When I approached them (i.e. Muhammad and Abu Bakr), my horse stumbled and I fell down from it, Then I stood up, got hold of my quiver and took out the divining arrows and drew lots as to whether I should harm them (i.e. the Prophet () and Abu Bakr) or not, and the lot which I disliked came out. But I remounted my horse and let it gallop, giving no importance to the divining arrows. When I heard the recitation of the Quran by Allah's Messenger () who did not look hither and thither while Abu Bakr was doing it often, suddenly the forelegs of my horse sank into the ground up to the knees, and I fell down from it. Then I rebuked it and it got up but could hardly take out its forelegs from the ground, and when it stood up straight again, its fore-legs caused dust to rise up in the sky like smoke. Then again I drew lots with the divining arrows, and the lot which I disliked, came out. So I called upon them to feel secure. They stopped, and I remounted my horse and went to them. When I saw how I had been hampered from harming them, it came to my mind that the cause of Allah's Messenger () (i.e. Islam) will become victorious. So I said to him, \"Your people have assigned a reward equal to the bloodmoney for your head.\" Then I told them all the plans the people of Mecca had made concerning them. Then I offered them some journey food and goods but they refused to take anything and did not ask for anything, but the Prophet () said, \"Do not tell others about us.\" Then I requested him to write for me a statement of security and peace. He ordered 'Amr bin Fuhaira who wrote it for me on a parchment, and then Allah's Messenger () proceeded on his way. \n\n \n\n   Narrated 'Urwa bin Az-Zubair:\n                      Allah's Messenger () met Az-Zubair in a caravan of Muslim merchants who were returning from Sham. Az-Zubair provided Allah's Messenger () and Abu Bakr with white clothes to wear. When the Muslims of Medina heard the news of the departure of Allah's Messenger () from Mecca (towards Medina), they started going to the Harra every morning . They would wait for him till the heat of the noon forced them to return. One day, after waiting for a long while, they returned home, and when they went into their houses, a Jew climbed up the roof of one of the forts of his people to look for some thing, and he saw Allah's Messenger () and his companions dressed in white clothes, emerging out of the desert mirage.  The Jew could not help shouting at the top of his voice, \"O you 'Arabs! Here is your great man whom you have been waiting for!\" So all the Muslims rushed to their arms and received Allah's Messenger () on the summit of Harra. The Prophet () turned with them to the right and alighted at the quarters of Bani 'Amr bin 'Auf, and this was on Monday in the month of Rabi-ul-Awal. Abu Bakr stood up, receiving the people while Allah's Messenger () sat down and kept silent. Some of the Ansar who came and had not seen Allah's Messenger () before, began greeting Abu Bakr, but when the sunshine fell on Allah's Messenger () and Abu Bakr came forward and shaded him with his sheet only then the people came to know Allah's Messenger (). Allah's Messenger () stayed with Bani 'Amr bin 'Auf for ten nights and established the mosque (mosque of Quba) which was founded on piety. Allah's Messenger () prayed in it and then mounted his she-camel and proceeded on, accompanied by the people till his she-camel knelt down at (the place of) the Mosque of Allah's Messenger () at Medina. Some Muslims used to pray there in those days, and that place was a yard for drying dates belonging to Suhail and Sahl, the orphan boys who were under the guardianship of 'Asad bin Zurara. When his she-camel knelt down, Allah's Messenger () said, \"This place, Allah willing, will be our abiding place.\" Allah's Messenger () then called the two boys and told them to suggest a price for that yard so that he might take it as a mosque. The two boys said, \"No, but we will give it as a gift, O Allah's Messenger ()!\" Allah's Messenger () then built a mosque there. The Prophet () himself started carrying unburnt bricks for its building and while doing so, he was saying \"This load is better than the load of Khaibar, for it is more pious in the Sight of Allah and purer and better rewardable.\" He was also saying, \"O Allah! The actual reward is the reward in the Hereafter, so bestow Your Mercy on the Ansar and the Emigrants.\" Thus the Prophet () recited (by way of proverb) the poem of some Muslim poet whose name is unknown to me. \n\n (Ibn Shibab said, \"In the Hadiths it does not occur that Allah's Apostle \n\n recited a complete poetic verse other than this one.\") ", "3755": "\nNarrated Asma:\nI prepared the journey food for the Prophet () and Abu Bakr when they wanted (to migrate to) Medina.

Who is this man in front of you?\" Abu Bakr \nwould say, \"This man shows me the Way,\" One would think that Abu Bakr meant the road, while in \nfact, Abu Bakr meant the way of virtue and good. Then Abu Bakr looked behind and saw a horse-rider \npersuing them. He said, \"O Allah's Messenger ()! This is a horse-rider persuing us.\" The Prophet () looked \nbehind and said, \"O Allah! Cause him to fall down.\" So the horse threw him down and got up \nneighing. After that the rider, Suraqa said, \"O Allah's Prophet! Order me whatever you want.\" The \nProphet said, \"Stay where you are and do not allow anybody to reach us.\" So, in the first part of the \nday Suraqa was an enemy of Allah's Prophet and in the last part of it, he was a protector. Then Allah's \nApostle alighted by the side of the Al-Harra and sent a message to the Ansar, and they came to Allah's \nProphet and Abu Bakr, and having greeted them, they said, \"Ride (your she-camels) safe and obeyed.\" \nAllah's Messenger () and Abu Bakr rode and the Ansar, carrying their arms, surrounded them.

Then I locked all \nthe doors of their houses from outside while they were inside, and ascended to Abu Rafi` by a \nstaircase. I saw the house in complete darkness with its light off, and I could not know where the man \nwas. So I called, 'O Abu Rafi`!' He replied, 'Who is it?' I proceeded towards the voice and hit him.

He said, 'Are you not surprised? \nWoe on your mother! A man has come to me and hit me with a sword!'

He drew lots amongst us during one of \nthe Ghazwat which he fought. The lot fell on me and so I proceeded with Allah's Messenger () after Allah's \norder of veiling (the women) had been revealed. I was carried (on the back of a camel) in my howdah \nand carried down while still in it (when we came to a halt). So we went on till Allah's Messenger () had \nfinished from that Ghazwa of his and returned. \nWhen we approached the city of Medina he announced at night that it was time for departure. So \nwhen they announced the news of departure, I got up and went away from the army camps, and after \nfinishing from the call of nature, I came back to my riding animal. I touched my chest to find that my \nnecklace which was made of Zifar beads (i.e. Yemenite beads partly black and partly white) was \nmissing. So I returned to look for my necklace and my search for it detained me. (In the meanwhile) \nthe people who used to carry me on my camel, came and took my howdah and put it on the back of \nmy camel on which I used to ride, as they considered that I was in it. In those days women were light \nin weight for they did not get fat, and flesh did not cover their bodies in abundance as they used to eat \nonly a little food. Those people therefore, disregarded the lightness of the howdah while lifting and \ncarrying it; and at that time I was still a young girl. They made the camel rise and all of them left \n(along with it). I found my necklace after the army had gone. \nThen I came to their camping place to find no call maker of them, nor one who would respond to the \ncall. So I intended to go to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come \nback to me (in my search). While I was sitting in my resting place, I was overwhelmed by sleep and \nslept. Safwan bin Al-Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army. When he reached my \nplace in the morning, he saw the figure of a sleeping person and he recognized me on seeing me as he \nhad seen me before the order of compulsory veiling (was prescribed). So I woke up when he recited \nIstirja' (i.e. \"Inna li l-lahi wa inna llaihi raji'un\") as soon as he recognized me. I veiled my face with \nmy head cover at once, and by Allah, we did not speak a single word, and I did not hear him saying \nany word besides his Istirja'. He dismounted from his camel and made it kneel down, putting his leg \non its front legs and then I got up and rode on it. Then he set out leading the camel that was carrying \nme till we overtook the army in the extreme heat of midday while they were at a halt (taking a rest). \n(Because of the event) some people brought destruction upon themselves and the one who spread the \nIfk (i.e. slander) more, was `Abdullah bin Ubai Ibn Salul.\" \n(Urwa said, \"The people propagated the slander and talked about it in his (i.e. `Abdullah's) presence \nand he confirmed it and listened to it and asked about it to let it prevail.\" `Urwa also added, \"None \nwas mentioned as members of the slanderous group besides (`Abdullah) except Hassan bin Thabit and \nMistah bin Uthatha and Hamna bint Jahsh along with others about whom I have no knowledge, but \nthey were a group as Allah said. It is said that the one who carried most of the slander was `Abdullah \nbin Ubai bin Salul.\" `Urwa added, \"`Aisha disliked to have Hassan abused in her presence and she \nused to say, 'It was he who said: My father and his (i.e. my father's) father and my honor are all for the \nprotection of Muhammad's honor from you.\"). \n`Aisha added, \"After we returned to Medina, I became ill for a month. The people were propagating \nthe forged statements of the slanderers while I was unaware of anything of all that, but I felt that in my \npresent ailment, I was not receiving the same kindness from Allah's Messenger () as I used to receive when \nI got sick. (But now) Allah's Messenger () would only come, greet me and say,' How is that (lady)?' and \nleave. That roused my doubts, but I did not discover the evil (i.e. slander) till I went out after my \nconvalescence, I went out with Um Mistah to Al-Manasi' where we used to answer the call of nature \nand we used not to go out (to answer the call of nature) except at night, and that was before we had \nlatrines near our houses. And this habit of our concerning evacuating the bowels, was similar to the \nhabits of the old 'Arabs living in the deserts, for it would be troublesome for us to take latrines near \nour houses. So I and Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abu Ruhm bin Al-Muttalib bin `Abd \nManaf, whose mother was the daughter of Sakhr bin 'Amir and the aunt of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq and \nwhose son was Mistah bin Uthatha bin `Abbas bin Al-Muttalib, went out. I and Um Mistah returned to \nmy house after we finished answering the call of nature. Um Mistah stumbled by getting her foot \nentangled in her covering sheet and on that she said, 'Let Mistah be ruined!' I said, 'What a hard word \nyou have said. Do you abuse a man who took part in the battle of Badr?' On that she said, 'O you \nHantah! Didn't you hear what he (i.e. Mistah) said? 'I said, 'What did he say?' \nThen she told me the slander of the people of Ifk. So my ailment was aggravated, and when I reached \nmy home, Allah's Messenger () came to me, and after greeting me, said, 'How is that (lady)?' I said, 'Will \nyou allow me to go to my parents?' as I wanted to be sure about the news through them. Allah's \nApostle allowed me (and I went to my parents) and asked my mother, 'O mother! What are the people \ntalking about?' She said, 'O my daughter! Don't worry, for scarcely is there a charming woman who is \nloved by her husband and whose husband has other wives besides herself that they (i.e. women) would \nfind faults with her.' I said, 'Subhan-Allah! (I testify the uniqueness of Allah). Are the people really \ntalking in this way?' I kept on weeping that night till dawn I could neither stop weeping nor sleep then \nin the morning again, I kept on weeping. When the Divine Inspiration was delayed. \nAllah's Messenger () called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid to ask and consult them about divorcing \nme. Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of my innocence, and the respect he preserved in himself for \nme. Usama said, '(O Allah's Messenger ()!) She is your wife and we do not know anything except good \nabout her.' `Ali bin Abi Talib said, 'O Allah's Messenger ()! Allah does not put you in difficulty and there \nare plenty of women other than she, yet, ask the maid-servant who will tell you the truth.' On that \nAllah's Messenger () called Barira (i.e. the maid-servant) and said, 'O Barira! Did you ever see anything \nwhich aroused your suspicion?' Barira said to him, 'By Him Who has sent you with the Truth. I have \nnever seen anything in her (i.e. Aisha) which I would conceal, except that she is a young girl who \nsleeps leaving the dough of her family exposed so that the domestic goats come and eat it.' \nSo, on that day, Allah's Messenger () got up on the pulpit and complained about `Abdullah bin Ubai (bin \nSalul) before his companions, saying, 'O you Muslims! Who will relieve me from that man who has \nhurt me with his evil statement about my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my \nfamily and they have blamed a man about whom I know nothing except good and he used never to \nenter my home except with me.' Sa`d bin Mu`adh the brother of Banu `Abd Al-Ashhal got up and \nsaid, 'O Allah's Messenger ()! I will relieve you from him; if he is from the tribe of Al-Aus, then I will chop \nhis head off, and if he is from our brothers, i.e. Al-Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your \norder.' On that, a man from Al-Khazraj got up. Um Hassan, his cousin, was from his branch tribe, and \nhe was Sa`d bin Ubada, chief of Al-Khazraj. Before this incident, he was a pious man, but his love for \nhis tribe goaded him into saying to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh). 'By Allah, you have told a lie; you shall not \nand cannot kill him. If he belonged to your people, you would not wish him to be killed.' \nOn that, Usaid bin Hudair who was the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin \n'Ubada, 'By Allah! You are a liar! We will surely kill him, and you are a hypocrite arguing on the \nbehalf of hypocrites.' On this, the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al Khazraj got so much excited that they \nwere about to fight while Allah's Messenger () was standing on the pulpit. Allah's Messenger () kept on \nquietening them till they became silent and so did he. All that day I kept on weeping with my tears \nnever ceasing, and I could never sleep. \nIn the morning my parents were with me and I wept for two nights and a day with my tears never \nceasing and I could never sleep till I thought that my liver would burst from weeping. So, while my \nparents were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked me to grant her admittance. I \nallowed her to come in, and when she came in, she sat down and started weeping with me. While we \nwere in this state, Allah's Messenger () came, greeted us and sat down. He had never sat with me since that \nday of the slander. A month had elapsed and no Divine Inspiration came to him about my case. Allah's \nApostle then recited Tashah-hud and then said, 'Amma Badu, O `Aisha! I have been informed so-andso \nabout you; if you are innocent, then soon Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have \ncommitted a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him for forgiveness for when a slave confesses his sins \nand asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance.' \n(continued...) \n(continuing... 1): -5.462:... ... \nWhen Allah's Messenger () finished his speech, my tears ceased flowing completely that I no longer felt a \nsingle drop of tear flowing. I said to my father, 'Reply to Allah's Messenger () on my behalf concerning \nwhat he has said.' My father said, 'By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah's Messenger () .' Then I \nsaid to my mother, 'Reply to Allah's Messenger () on my behalf concerning what he has said.' She said, 'By \nAllah, I do not know what to say to Allah's Messenger ().' In spite of the fact that I was a young girl and had \na little knowledge of Qur'an, I said, 'By Allah, no doubt I know that you heard this (slanderous) speech \nso that it has been planted in your hearts (i.e. minds) and you have taken it as a truth. Now if I tell you \nthat I am innocent, you will not believe me, and if confess to you about it, and Allah knows that I am \ninnocent, you will surely believe me. By Allah, I find no similitude for me and you except that of \nJoseph's father when he said, '(For me) patience in the most fitting against that which you assert; it is \nAllah (Alone) Whose Help can be sought.' Then I turned to the other side and lay on my bed; and \nAllah knew then that I was innocent and hoped that Allah would reveal my innocence.

Do you not love that Allah should forgive you? And Allah is oft-Forgiving Most Merciful.\" \n(24.22) \nAbu Bakr As-Siddiq said, 'Yes, by Allah, I would like that Allah forgive me.' and went on giving \nMistah the money he used to give him before.

Shall I \ngive 2/3 of my property as alms (in charity)?\" The Prophet () said, \"No,\" I said, \"Shall I give half of my \nproperty as alms?\" He said, \"No.\" I said, \"(Shall I give) 1/3 of it? \" He replied, \" 1/3, and even 1/3 is \ntoo much. It is better for you to leave your inheritors wealthy rather than to leave them poor, begging \npeople (for their sustenance); and whatever you spend for Allah's Sake, you will get reward for it even \nfor the morsel of food which you put in your wives mouth.\" I said, \"O Allah's Messenger ()! Should I \nremain (in Mecca) behind my companions (who are going with you to Medina)?\" The Prophet () said, \n\"If you remain behind, any good deed which you will do for Allah's Sake, will upgrade and elevate \nyou. May be you will live longer so that some people may benefit by you and some other (i.e. infidels) \nmay get harmed by you.\" The Prophet () then added, \"O Allah!

He replied, \"It was \nAl-`Anaq (i.e. moderate easy speed) and if he encountered an open space, he used to increase his \nspeed.\"", "4231": "\nNarrated `Abdullah bin Yazid Al-Khatmi:\nThat Abu Aiyub informed him that he offered the Maghrib and `Isha' prayers together with the \nProphet during Hajjat-ul-Wada`.", "4232": "\nNarrated Abu Musa:\nMy Companions sent me to Allah's Messenger () to ask him for some animals to ride on as they were \naccompanying him in the army of Al-Usra, and that was the Ghazwa (Battle) of Tabuk, I said, \"O \nAllah's Prophet! My companions have sent me to you to provide them with means of transportation.\" \nHe said, \"By Allah! I will not make you ride anything.\" It happened that when I reached him, he was \nin an angry mood, and I didn't notice it. So I returned in a sad mood because of the refusal the Prophet () \nand for the fear that the Prophet () might have become 'angry with me. So I returned to my companions \nand informed them of what the Prophet () had said. Only a short while had passed when I heard Bilal \ncalling, \"O `Abdullah bin Qais!\" I replied to his call. Bilal said, \"Respond to Allah's Messenger () who is \ncalling you.\" When I went to him (i.e. the Prophet), he said, \"Take these two camels tied together and \nalso these two camels tied together,\"' referring to six camels he had brought them from Sa`d at that \ntime. The Prophet () added, \"Take them to your companions and say, 'Allah (or Allah's Messenger () ) allows \nyou to ride on these,' so ride on them.\" So I took those camels to them and said, \"The Prophet () allows \nyou to ride on these (camels) but by Allah, I will not leave you till some of you proceed with me to \nsomebody who heard the statement of Allah's Messenger (). Do not think that I narrate to you a thing which \nAllah's Messenger () has not said.\" They said to me, \"We consider you truthful, and we will do what you \nlike.\" The sub-narrator added: So Abu Musa proceeded along with some of them till they came to \nthose who have heard the statement of Allah's Messenger () wherein he denied them (some animals to ride \non) and (his statement) whereby he gave them the same. So these people told them the same \ninformation as Abu Musa had told them.", "4233": "\nNarrated Sa`d:\nAllah's Messenger () set out for Tabuk. appointing `Ali as his deputy (in Medina). `Ali said, \"Do you want \nto leave me with the children and women?\" The Prophet () said, \"Will you not be pleased that you will \nbe to me like Aaron to Moses? But there will be no prophet after me.\"", "4234": "\nNarrated Safwan bin Ya`la bin Umaiya:\nthat his father said, \"I participated in Al-Usra (i.e. Tabuk) along with the Prophet.\" Ya`la added, \"(My \nparticipation in) that Ghazwa was the best of my deeds to me.\" Ya`la said, \"I had a laborer who \nquarrelled with somebody, and one of the two bit the hand of the other (`Ata', the sub-narrator, said, \n\"Safwan told me who bit whom but I forgot it\"), and the one who was bitten, pulled his hand out of \nthe mouth of the biter, so one of the incisors of the biter was broken. So we came to the Prophet () and \nhe considered the biter's claim as invalid (i.e. the biter did not get a recompense for his broken \nincisor). The Prophet () said, \"Should he leave his hand in your mouth so that you might snap it as if it \nwere in the mouth of a male camel to snap it?\"", "4235": "\nNarrated `Abdullah bin Ka`b bin Malik:\nWho, from among Ka`b's sons, was the guide of Ka`b when he became blind: I heard Ka`b bin Malik \nnarrating the story of (the Ghazwa of) Tabuk in which he failed to take part. Ka`b said, \"I did not \nremain behind Allah's Messenger () in any Ghazwa that he fought except the Ghazwa of Tabuk, and I failed \nto take part in the Ghazwa of Badr, but Allah did not admonish anyone who had not participated in it, \nfor in fact, Allah's Messenger () had gone out in search of the caravan of Quraish till Allah made them (i.e. \nthe Muslims) and their enemy meet without any appointment. I witnessed the night of Al-`Aqaba \n(pledge) with Allah's Messenger () when we pledged for Islam, and I would not exchange it for the Badr \nbattle although the Badr battle is more popular amongst the people than it (i.e. Al-`Aqaba pledge). As \nfor my news (in this battle of Tabuk), I had never been stronger or wealthier than I was when I \nremained behind the Prophet () in that Ghazwa. \nBy Allah, never had I two she-camels before, but I had then at the time of this Ghazwa. Whenever \nAllah's Messenger () wanted to make a Ghazwa, he used to hide his intention by apparently referring to \ndifferent Ghazwa till it was the time of that Ghazwa (of Tabuk) which Allah's Messenger () fought in \nsevere heat, facing, a long journey, desert, and the great number of enemy. So the Prophet () announced \nto the Muslims clearly (their destination) so that they might get prepared for their Ghazwa. So he \ninformed them clearly of the destination he was going to. Allah's Messenger () was accompanied by a large \nnumber of Muslims who could not be listed in a book namely, a register.\" Ka`b added, \"Any man who \nintended to be absent would think that the matter would remain hidden unless Allah revealed it \nthrough Divine Revelation. So Allah's Messenger () fought that Ghazwa at the time when the fruits had \nripened and the shade looked pleasant. Allah's Messenger () and his companions prepared for the battle and \nI started to go out in order to get myself ready along with them, but I returned without doing anything. \nI would say to myself, 'I can do that.' So I kept on delaying it every now and then till the people got \nready and Allah's Messenger () and the Muslims along with him departed, and I had not prepared anything \nfor my departure, and I said, I will prepare myself (for departure) one or two days after him, and then \njoin them.' In the morning following their departure, I went out to get myself ready but returned \nhaving done nothing. Then again in the next morning, I went out to get ready but returned without \ndoing anything. \nSuch was the case with me till they hurried away and the battle was missed (by me). Even then I \nintended to depart to take them over. I wish I had done so! But it was not in my luck. So, after the \ndeparture of Allah's Messenger (), whenever I went out and walked amongst the people (i.e, the remaining \npersons), it grieved me that I could see none around me, but one accused of hypocrisy or one of those \nweak men whom Allah had excused. Allah's Messenger () did not remember me till he reached Tabuk. \nSo while he was sitting amongst the people in Tabuk, he said, 'What did Ka`b do?' A man from Banu \nSalama said, 'O Allah's Messenger ()! He has been stopped by his two Burdas (i.e. garments) and his \nlooking at his own flanks with pride.' Then Mu`adh bin Jabal said, 'What a bad thing you have said! \nBy Allah! O Allahs Apostle! We know nothing about him but good.' Allah's Messenger () kept silent.\" Ka`b \nbin Malik added, \"When I heard that he (i.e. the Prophet () ) was on his way back to Medina. I got \ndipped in my concern, and began to think of false excuses, saying to myself, 'How can I avoid his \nanger tomorrow?' And I took the advice of wise member of my family in this matter. \nWhen it was said that Allah's Messenger (), had come near all the evil false excuses abandoned from my \nmind and I knew well that I could never come out of this problem by forging a false statement. Then I \ndecided firmly to speak the truth. So Allah's Messenger () arrived in the morning, and whenever he returned \nfrom a journey., he used to visit the Mosque first of all and offer a two-rak`at prayer therein and then \nsit for the people. So when he had done all that (this time), those who had failed to join the battle (of \nTabuk) came and started offering (false) excuses and taking oaths before him. They were something \nover eighty men; Allah's Messenger () accepted the excuses they had expressed, took their pledge of \nallegiance asked for Allah's Forgiveness for them, and left the secrets of their hearts for Allah to \njudge. \nThen I came to him, and when I greeted him, he smiled a smile of an angry person and then said, \n'Come on.' So I came walking till I sat before him. He said to me, 'What stopped you from joining us. \nHad you not purchased an animal For carrying you?' I answered, \"Yes, O Allah's Messenger ()! But by \nAllah, if I were sitting before any person from among the people of the world other than you, I would \nhave avoided his anger with an excuse. \nBy Allah, I have been bestowed with the power of speaking fluently and eloquently, but by Allah, I \nknew well that if today I tell you a lie to seek your favor, Allah would surely make you angry with me \nin the near future, but if I tell you the truth, though you will get angry because of it, I hope for Allah's \nForgiveness. Really, by Allah, there was no excuse for me. By Allah, I had never been stronger or \nwealthier than I was when I remained behind you.' Then Allah's Messenger () said, 'As regards this man, he \nhas surely told the truth. So get up till Allah decides your case.' I got up, and many men of Banu \nSalama followed me and said to me. 'By Allah, we never witnessed you doing any sin before this. \nSurely, you failed to offer excuse to Allah's Messenger () as the others who did not join him, have offered. \nThe prayer of Allah's Messenger () to Allah to forgive you would have been sufficient for you.' By Allah, \nthey continued blaming me so much that I intended to return (to the Prophet) and accuse myself of \nhaving told a lie, but I said to them, 'Is there anybody else who has met the same fate as I have?' They \nreplied, 'Yes, there are two men who have said the same thing as you have, and to both of them was \ngiven the same order as given to you.' I said, 'Who are they?' They replied, Murara bin Ar-Rabi Al- \nAmri and Hilal bin Umaiya Al-Waqifi.' By that they mentioned to me two pious men who had \nattended the Ghazwa (Battle) of Badr, and in whom there was an example for me. So I did not change \nmy mind when they mentioned them to me. Allah's Messenger () forbade all the Muslims to talk to us, the \nthree aforesaid persons out of all those who had remained behind in that Ghazwa. So we kept away \nfrom the people and they changed their attitude towards us till the very land (where I lived) appeared \nstrange to me as if I did not know it. \nWe remained in that condition for fifty nights. As regards my two fellows, they remained in their \nhouses and kept on weeping, but I was the youngest of them and the firmest of them, so I used to go \nout and witness the prayers along with the Muslims and roam about in the markets, but none would \ntalk to me, and I would come to Allah's Messenger () and greet him while he was sitting In his gathering \nafter the prayer, and I would wonder whether the Prophet () did move his lips in return to my greetings \nor not. Then I would offer my prayer near to him and look at him stealthily. When I was busy with my \nprayer, he would turn his face towards me, but when I turned my face to him, he would turn his face \naway from me. When this harsh attitude of the people lasted long, I walked till I scaled the wall of the \ngarden of Abu Qatada who was my cousin and dearest person to me, and I offered my greetings to \nhim. By Allah, he did not return my greetings. I said, 'O Abu Qatada! I beseech you by Allah! Do you \nknow that I love Allah and His Apostle?' He kept quiet. I asked him again, beseeching him by Allah, \nbut he remained silent. Then I asked him again in the Name of Allah. He said, \"Allah and His Apostle \nknow it better.' Thereupon my eyes flowed with tears and I returned and jumped over the wall.\" Ka`b \nadded, \"While I was walking in the market of Medina, suddenly I saw a Nabati (i.e. a Christian \nfarmer) from the Nabatis of Sham who came to sell his grains in Medina, saying, 'Who will lead me to \nKa`b bin Malik?' The people began to point (me) out for him till he came to me and handed me a letter \nfrom the king of Ghassan in which the following was written: \n\"To proceed, I have been informed that your friend (i.e. the Prophet () ) has treated you harshly. \nAnyhow, Allah does not let you live at a place where you feel inferior and your right is lost. So join \nus, and we will console you.\" \nWhen I read it, I said to myself, 'This is also a sort of a test.' Then I took the letter to the oven and \nmade a fire therein by burning it. When forty out of the fifty nights elapsed, behold ! There came to \nme the messenger of Allah's Messenger () and said, 'Allah's Messenger () orders you to keep away from your \nwife,' I said, 'Should I divorce her; or else! what should I do?' He said, 'No, only keep aloof from her \nand do not cohabit her.' The Prophet () sent the same message to my two fellows. Then I said to my \nwife. 'Go to your parents and remain with them till Allah gives His Verdict in this matter.\" Ka`b \nadded, \"The wife of Hilal bin Umaiya came to Apostle and said, 'O Allah's Messenger ()! Hilal bin Umaiya \nis a helpless old man who has no servant to attend on him. Do you dislike that I should serve him? ' \nHe said, 'No (you can serve him) but he should not come near you.' She said, 'By Allah, he has no \ndesire for anything. By, Allah, he has never ceased weeping till his case began till this day of his.' \n(continued...) \n(continuing... 1): -5.702:... ... \nOn that, some of my family members said to me, 'Will you also ask Allah's Messenger () to permit your \nwife (to serve you) as he has permitted the wife of Hilal bin Umaiya to serve him?' I said, 'By Allah, I \nwill not ask the permission of Allah's Messenger () regarding her, for I do not know What Allah's Messenger () \nwould say if I asked him to permit her (to serve me) while I am a young man.' Then I remained in that \nstate for ten more nights after that till the period of fifty nights was completed starting from the time \nwhen Allah's Messenger () prohibited the people from talking to us. When I had offered the Fajr prayer on \nthe 50th morning on the roof of one of our houses and while I was sitting in the condition which Allah \ndescribed (in the Qur'an) i.e. my very soul seemed straitened to me and even the earth seemed narrow \nto me for all its spaciousness, there I heard the voice of one who had ascended the mountain of Sala' \ncalling with his loudest voice, 'O Ka`b bin Malik! Be happy (by receiving good tidings).' I fell down \nin prostration before Allah, realizing that relief has come. Allah's Messenger () had announced the \nacceptance of our repentance by Allah when he had offered the Fajr prayer. The people then went out \nto congratulate us. Some bringers of good tidings went out to my two fellows, and a horseman came to \nme in haste, and a man of Banu Aslam came running and ascended the mountain and his voice was \nswifter than the horse. When he (i.e. the man) whose voice I had heard, came to me conveying the \ngood tidings, I took off my garments and dressed him with them; and by Allah, I owned no other \ngarments than them on that day. Then I borrowed two garments and wore them and went to Allah's \nApostle. \nThe people started receiving me in batches, congratulating me on Allah's Acceptance of my \nrepentance, saying, 'We congratulate you on Allah's Acceptance of your repentance.\" Ka`b further \nsaid, \"When I entered the Mosque. I saw Allah's Messenger () sitting with the people around him. Talha bin \nUbaidullah swiftly came to me, shook hands with me and congratulated me. By Allah, none of the \nMuhajirin (i.e. Emigrants) got up for me except him (i.e. Talha), and I will never forget this for \nTalha.\" Ka`b added, \"When I greeted Allah's Messenger () he, his face being bright with joy, said \"Be \nhappy with the best day that you have got ever since your mother delivered you.\" Ka`b added, \"I said \nto the Prophet () 'Is this forgiveness from you or from Allah?' He said, 'No, it is from Allah.' Whenever \nAllah's Messenger () became happy, his face would shine as if it were a piece of moon, and we all knew \nthat characteristic of him. When I sat before him, I said, 'O Allah's Messenger ()! Because of the acceptance \nof my repentance I will give up all my wealth as alms for the Sake of Allah and His Apostle. Allah's \nApostle said, 'Keep some of your wealth, as it will be better for you.' I said, 'So I will keep my share \nfrom Khaibar with me,' and added, 'O Allah's Messenger ()! Allah has saved me for telling the truth; so it is \na part of my repentance not to tell but the truth as long as I am alive. By Allah, I do not know anyone \nof the Muslims whom Allah has helped fortelling the truth more than me. Since I have mentioned that \ntruth to Allah's Messenger () till today, I have never intended to tell a lie. I hope that Allah will also save \nme (from telling lies) the rest of my life. So Allah revealed to His Apostle the Verse:-- \n\"Verily, Allah has forgiven the Prophet, the Muhajirin (i.e. Emigrants (up to His Saying) And be with \nthose who are true (in word and deed).\" (9.117-119) \nBy Allah, Allah has never bestowed upon me, apart from His guiding me to Islam, a Greater blessing \nthan the fact that I did not tell a lie to Allah's Messenger () which would have caused me to perish as those \nwho have told a lie perished, for Allah described those who told lies with the worst description He \never attributed to anybody else. Allah said:-- \"They (i.e. the hypocrites) will swear by Allah to you \nwhen you return to them (up to His Saying) Certainly Allah is not pleased with the rebellious people-- \n\" (9.95-96) Ka`b added, \"We, the three persons, differed altogether from those whose excuses Allah's \nApostle accepted when they swore to him. He took their pledge of allegiance and asked Allah to \nforgive them, but Allah's Messenger () left our case pending till Allah gave His Judgment about it. As for \nthat Allah said):-- And to the three (He did for give also) who remained behind.\" (9.118) \nWhat Allah said (in this Verse) does not indicate our failure to take part in the Ghazwa, but it refers to \nthe deferment of making a decision by the Prophet () about our case in contrast to the case of those who \nhad taken an oath before him and he excused them by accepting their excuses.", "4236": "\nNarrated Ibn `Umar:\nWhen the Prophet () passed by Al-Hijr, he said, \"Do not enter the dwelling places of those people who \nwere unjust to themselves unless you enter in a weeping state lest the same calamity as of theirs \nshould befall you.\" Then he covered his head and made his speed fast till he crossed the valley.", "4237": "\nNarrated Ibn `Umar:\nAllah's Messenger () said to his companions who were at Al-Hijr, \"Do not enter upon these people who are \nbeing punished, except in a weeping state, lest the same calamity as of theirs should befall you...\"", "4238": "\nNarrated `Urwa bin Al-Mughira:\nAl-Mughira bin Shu`ba, said, \"The Prophet () went out to answer the call of nature and (when he had \nfinished) I got up to pour water for him.\" I think that he said that the event had taken place during the \nGhazwa of Tabuk.

In fact, such are the followers of the \nApostles. \nThen I asked you whether you have ever accused him of telling lies before saying what he said, and \nyour reply was in the negative.

And such is Faith when it mixes with the \ncheerfulness of the hearts. \nThen I asked you whether his followers were increasing or decreasing. You claimed that they were \nincreasing. That is the way of true faith till it is complete. \nThen I asked you whether you had ever fought with him, and you claimed that you had fought with \nhim and the battle between you and him was undecided and the victory was shared by you and him in \nturns; he inflicted casual ties upon you and you inflicted casualties upon them. Such is the case with \nthe Apostles; they are out to test and the final victory is for them. \nThen I asked you whether he had ever betrayed; you claimed that he had never betrayed. I need, \nApostles never betray. \nThen I asked you whether anyone had said this statement before him; and you denied that.

If I were \ncertain that I can reach him, I would like to meet him and if I were with him, I would wash his feet; \nand his kingdom will expand (surely to what is under my feet.'

So Allah revealed to him: 'At the junction of the two seas there is a slave of Ours who is more \nlearned than you.' Moses asked, 'O my Lord, how can I meet him?' Allah said, 'Take a fish and put it \nin a basket (and set out), and where you, will lose the fish, you will find him.' So Moses (took a fish \nand put it in a basket and) set out, along with his boy-servant Yusha` bin Noon, till they reached a \nrock (on which) they both lay their heads and slept. The fish moved vigorously in the basket and got \nout of it and fell into the sea and there it took its way through the sea (straight) as in a tunnel). (18.61) \nAllah stopped the current of water on both sides of the way created by the fish, and so that way was \nlike a tunnel. When Moses got up, his companion forgot to tell him about the fish, and so they carried \non their journey during the rest of the day and the whole night. \nThe next morning Moses asked his boy-servant 'Bring us our early meal; no doubt, we have suffered \nmuch fatigue in this journey of ours.' (18.62) Moses did not get tired till he had passed the place \nwhich Allah had ordered him to seek after. His boy-servant then said to him,' 'Do you remember when \nwe be-took ourselves to the rock I indeed forgot the fish, none but Satan made me forget to remember \nit. It took its course into the sea in a marvelous way.' (18.63) \nThere was a tunnel for the fish and for Moses and his boy-servant there was astonishment. Moses said, \n'That is what we have been seeking'. So they went back retracing their footsteps. (18.64) They both \nreturned, retracing their steps till they reached the rock. Behold ! There they found a man covered \nwith a garment. Moses greeted him. Al-Khadir said astonishingly. 'Is there such a greeting in your \nland?' Moses said, 'I am Moses.' He said, 'Are you the Moses of the children of Israel?' Moses said, 'I \nhave come to you so that you may teach me of what you have been taught. \nAl-Khadir said, 'You will not be able to have patience with me. (18.66) O Moses! I have some of \nAllah's knowledge which He has bestowed upon me but you do not know it; and you too, have some \nof Allah's knowledge which He has bestowed upon you, but I do not know it.\" Moses said, \"Allah \nwilling, you will find me patient, and I will not disobey you in anything.'

'If you then follow me, do not ask me about anything until I myself speak to you concerning it.' \n(18.70), After that both of them proceeded along the sea coast, till a boat passed by and they requested \nthe crew to let them go on board. The crew recognized Al-Khadir and allowed them to get on board \nfree of charge. When they got on board suddenly Moses saw that Al-Khadir had pulled out one of the \nplanks of the boat with an adze. Moses said to him.' These people gave us a free lift, yet you have \nscuttled their boat so as to drown its people! Truly, you have done a dreadful thing.' (18.71) \nAl-Khadir said, 'Didn't I say that you can have no patience with me ?' (18.72) Moses said, 'Call me not \nto account for what I forgot and be not hard upon me for my affair (with you.)\" (18.73) \nAllah's Messenger () said, \"The first excuse given by Moses, was that he had forgotten. Then a sparrow \ncame and sat over the edge of the boat and dipped its beak once in the sea.

Then they both got out of the boat, and while they were walking on the sea shore, \nAl-Khadir saw a boy playing with other boys. Al-Khadir got hold of the head of that boy and pulled it \nout with his hands and killed him. Moses said, 'Have you killed an innocent soul who has killed \nnobody! Truly, you have done an illegal thing.' (18.74) He said, \"Didn't I tell you that you can have no \npatience with me?'

(In that town) they found there a wall on the point of falling down. (18.77) \nAl-Khadir set it up straight with his own hands. Moses said, 'These are people to whom we came, but \nthey neither fed us nor received us as guests. If you had wished, you could surely have exacted some \nrecompense for it.

May Allah let me be sacrificed for you ! There is a man at Kufa who is a storyteller \r\ncalled Nauf; who claims that he (Al-Khadir's companion) is not Moses of Bani Israel.\" As for \r\n`Amr, he said to me, \"Ibn `Abbas said, \"(Nauf) the enemy of Allah told a lie.\" But Ya`la said to me, \r\n\"Ibn `Abbas said, Ubai bin Ka`b said, Allah's Messenger () said, 'Once Moses, Allah's Messenger (), preached to \r\nthe people till their eyes shed tears and their hearts became tender, whereupon he finished his sermon. \r\nThen a man came to Moses and asked, 'O Allah's Messenger ()! Is there anyone on the earth who is more \r\nlearned than you?' Moses replied, 'No.' So Allah admonished him (Moses), for he did not ascribe all \r\nknowledge to Allah. It was said, (on behalf of Allah), 'Yes, (there is a slave of ours who knows more \r\nthan you ).' Moses said, 'O my Lord! Where is he?' Allah said, 'At the junction of the two seas.'

' (18.60) Yusha` bin Noon. (Sa`id did not state \r\nthat). The Prophet () said, \"While the attendant was in the shade of the rock at a wet place, the fish \r\nslipped out (alive) while Moses was sleeping. His attend an said (to himself), \"I will not wake him, but \r\nwhen he woke up, he forgot to tell him The fish slipped out and entered the sea. Allah stopped the \r\nflow of the sea. where the fish was, so that its trace looked as if it was made on a rock. `Amr forming \r\na hole with his two thumbs an index fingers, said to me, \"Like this, as in its trace was made on a \r\nrock.\" \r\nMoses said \"We have suffered much fatigue on this journey of ours.\" (This was not narrated by Sa`id). \r\nThen they returned back and found Al-Khadir. `Uthman bin Abi Sulaiman said to me, (they found \r\nhim) on a green carpet in the middle of the sea. Al-Khadir was covered with his garment with one end \r\nunder his feet and the other end under his head. When Moses greeted, he uncovered his face and said \r\nastonishingly, 'Is there such a greeting in my land? Who are you?' Moses said, 'I am Moses.' Al- \r\nKhadir said, 'Are you the Moses of Bani Israel?' Moses said, 'Yes.' Al-Khadir said, \"What do you \r\nwant?' Moses said, ' I came to you so that you may teach me of the truth which you were taught.' Al- \r\nKhadir said, 'Is it not sufficient for you that the Torah is in your hands and the Divine Inspiration \r\ncomes to you, O Moses? Verily, I have a knowledge that you ought not learn, and you have a \r\nknowledge which I ought not learn.' At that time a bird took with its beak (some water) from the sea: \r\nAl-Khadir then said, 'By Allah, my knowledge and your knowledge besides Allah's Knowledge is like \r\nwhat this bird has taken with its beak from the sea.' Until, when they went on board the boat (18.71). \r\nThey found a small boat which used to carry the people from this sea-side to the other sea-side. The \r\ncrew recognized Al-Khadir and said, 'The pious slave of Allah.' (We said to Sa`id \"Was that Khadir?\" \r\nHe said, \"Yes.\") The boat men said, 'We will not get him on board with fare.' Al-Khadir scuttled the \r\nboat and then plugged the hole with a piece of wood. \r\nMoses said, 'Have you scuttled it in order to drown these people surely, you have done a dreadful thing. \r\n(18.71) (Mujahid said. \"Moses said so protestingly.\") Al-Khadir said, didn't I say that you can have no \r\npatience with me?' (18.72) The first inquiry of Moses was done because of forgetfulness, the second \r\ncaused him to be bound with a stipulation, and the third was done intentionally. Moses said, 'Call \r\nme not to account for what I forgot and be not hard upon me for my affair (with you).' (18.73) \r\n(Then) they found a boy and Al-Khadir killed him. Ya`la- said: Sa`id said 'They found boys playing \r\nand Al-Khadir got hold of a handsome infidel boy laid him down and then slew him with knife. Moses \r\nsaid, 'Have you killed a innocent soul who has killed nobody' (18.74) Then they proceeded and found \r\na wall which was on the point of falling down, and Al-Khadir set it up straight. Sa`id moved his hand \r\nthus and said 'Al-Khadir raised his hand and the wall became straight. Ya`la said, 'I think Sa`id said, \r\n'Al-Khadir touched the wall with his hand and it became straight (Moses said to Al-Khadir), 'If you \r\nhad wished, you could have taken wages for it.' Sa`id said, 'Wages that we might had eaten.' And there \r\nwas a king in furor (ahead) of them\" (18.79) And there was in front of them. Ibn `Abbas recited: 'In \r\nfront of them (was) a king.' \r\nIt is said on the authority of somebody other than Sa`id that the king was Hudad bin Budad. They say \r\nthat the boy was called Haisur. 'A king who seized every ship by force. (18.79) So I wished that if that \r\nboat passed by him, he would leave it because of its defect and when they have passed they would \r\nrepair it and get benefit from it. Some people said that they closed that hole with a bottle, and some \r\nsaid with tar. 'His parents were believers, and he (the boy) was a non-believer and we (Khadir) feared \r\nlest he would oppress them by obstinate rebellion and disbelief.' (18.80) (i.e. that their love for him \r\nwould urge them to follow him in his religion, 'so we (Khadir) desired that their Lord should change \r\nhim for them for one better in righteousness and near to mercy' (18:81). This was in reply to Moses' \r\nsaying: Have you killed an innocent soul.'? (18.74). 'Near to mercy\" means they will be more merciful \r\nto him than they were to the former whom Khadir had killed. Other than Sa`id, said that they were \r\ncompensated with a girl. Dawud bin Abi `Asim said on the authority of more than one that this next \r\nchild was a girl.", "4537": "\nNarrated Sa`id bin Jubair:\nI said to Ibn `Abbas, \"Nauf-al-Bakali \" claims that Moses of Bani Israel was not Moses, the \ncompanion of Al-Khadir.\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"Allah's enemy tells a lie!

How can meet him?' Allah said, 'Take a fish in a basket and wherever the \nfish is lost, follow it (you will find him at that place). So Moses set out along with his attendant \nYusha` bin Noon, and they carried with them a fish till they reached a rock and rested there. Moses \nput his head down and slept. (Sufyan, a sub-narrator said that somebody other than `Amr said) 'At the \nrock there was a water spring called 'Al-Hayat' and none came in touch with its water but became \nalive. So some of the water of that spring fell over that fish, so it moved and slipped out of the basket \nand entered the sea. When Moses woke up, he asked his attendant, 'Bring our early meal' (18.62). \nThe narrator added: Moses did not suffer from fatigue except after he had passed the place he had \nbeen ordered to observe. His attendant Yusha` bin Noon said to him, 'Do you remember (what \nhappened) when we betook ourselves to the rock? I did indeed forget (about) the fish ...' (18.63) The \nnarrator added: So they came back, retracing their steps and then they found in the sea, the way of the \nfish looking like a tunnel. So there was an astonishing event for his attendant, and there was tunnel for \nthe fish. When they reached the rock, they found a man covered with a garment. Moses greeted him. \nThe man said astonishingly, 'Is there any such greeting in your land?' Moses said, 'I am Moses.' The \nman said, 'Moses of Bani Israel?'

Moses \nsaid, 'But I will follow you.' Al-Khadir said, 'Then if you follow me, ask me no question about \nanything until I myself speak to you concerning it.' (18.70). After that both of them proceeded along \nthe seashore. There passed by them a boat whose crew recognized Al-Khadir and received them on \nboard free of charge. So they both got on board. A sparrow came and sat on the edge of the boat and \ndipped its beak unto the sea. Al-Khadir said to Moses. 'My knowledge and your knowledge and all the \ncreation's knowledge compared to Allah's knowledge is not more than the water taken by this \nsparrow's beak.' \nThen Moses was startled by Al-Khadir's action of taking an adze and scuttling the boat with it. Moses \nsaid to him, 'These people gave us a free lift, but you intentionally scuttled their boat so as to drown \nthem. Surely you have...' (18.71) Then they both proceeded and found a boy playing with other \nboys. Al-Khadir took hold of him by the head and cut it off.

If I kept her I would oppress her.\" So \n'Uwaimir divorced her and so divorce became a tradition after them for those who happened to be \ninvolved in a case of Mula'ana. Allah's Messenger () then said, \"Look! If she (Uwaimir's wife) delivers a \nblack child with deep black large eyes, big hips and fat legs, then I will be of the opinion that \n'Uwaimir has spoken the truth; but if she delivers a red child looking like a Wahra then we will \nconsider that 'Uwaimir has told a lie against her.\" Later on she delivered a child carrying the qualities \nwhich Allah's Messenger () had mentioned as a proof for 'Uwaimir's claim; therefore the child was ascribed \nto its mother henceforth.", "4556": "\nNarrated Sahl bin Sa`d:\nA man came to Allah's Messenger () and said, \"O Allah's Messenger ()! Suppose a man saw another man with \nhis wife, should he kill him whereupon you might kill him (i.e. the killer) (in Qisas) or what should he \ndo?\" So Allah revealed concerning their case what is mentioned of the order of Mula'ana. Allah's \nApostle said to the man, \"The matter between you and your wife has been decided.\" So they did \nMula'ana in the presence of Allah's Messenger () and I was present there, and then the man divorced his \nwife. So it became a tradition to dissolve the marriage of those spouses who were involved in a case of \nMula'ana. The woman was pregnant and the husband denied that he was the cause of her pregnancy, \nso the son was (later) ascribed to her. Then it became a tradition that such a son would be the heir of \nhis mother, and she would inherit of him what Allah prescribed for her.", "4557": "\nNarrated Ibn `Abbas:\nHilal bin Umaiya accused his wife of committing illegal sexual intercourse with Sharik bin Sahma' \nand filed the case before the Prophet. The Prophet () said (to Hilal), \"Either you bring forth a proof (four \nwitnesses) or you will receive the legal punishment (lashes) on your back.\" Hilal said, \"O Allah's \nApostle! If anyone of us saw a man over his wife, would he go to seek after witnesses?\" The Prophet () \nkept on saying, \"Either you bring forth the witnesses or you will receive the legal punishment (lashes) \non your back.\" Hilal then said, \"By Him Who sent you with the Truth, I am telling the truth and Allah \nwill reveal to you what will save my back from legal punishment.\" Then Gabriel came down and \nrevealed to him:-- \n'As for those who accuse their wives...' (24.6-9) The Prophet () recited it till he reached: '... (her \naccuser) is telling the truth.' Then the Prophet () left and sent for the woman, and Hilal went (and \nbrought) her and then took the oaths (confirming the claim). The Prophet () was saying, \"Allah knows \nthat one of you is a liar, so will any of you repent?\" Then the woman got up and took the oaths and \nwhen she was going to take the fifth one, the people stopped her and said, \"It (the fifth oath) will \ndefinitely bring Allah's curse on you (if you are guilty).\" So she hesitated and recoiled (from taking \nthe oath) so much that we thought that she would withdraw her denial. But then she said, \"I will not \ndishonor my family all through these days,\" and carried on (the process of taking oaths). The Prophet () \nthen said, \"Watch her; if she delivers a black-eyed child with big hips and fat shins then it is Sharik \nbin Sahma's child.\" Later she delivered a child of that description. So the Prophet () said, \"If the case \nwas not settled by Allah's Law, I would punish her severely.\"", "4558": "\nNarrated Ibn `Umar:\nA man accused his wife of illegal sexual intercourse and denied his paternity to her (conceived) child \nduring the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (). Allah's Messenger () ordered them both to do Mula'ana as Allah \ndecreed and then gave his decision that the child would be for the mother, and a divorce decree was \nissued for the couple involved in a case of Mula'ana.", "4559": "\nNarrated `Aisha:\nAnd as for him among them who had the greater share..' (24.11) was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul.", "4560": "\nNarrated Aisha:\n(The wife of the Prophet) Whenever Allah's Messenger () intended to go on a journey, he used to draw lots \namong his wives and would take with him the one on whom the lot had fallen. Once he drew lots \nwhen he wanted to carry out a Ghazwa, and the lot came upon me. So I proceeded with Allah's \nApostle after Allah's order of veiling (the women) had been revealed and thus I was carried in my \nhowdah (on a camel) and dismounted while still in it. We carried on our journey, and when Allah's \nApostle had finished his Ghazwa and returned and we approached Medina, Allah's Messenger () ordered to \nproceed at night. When the army was ordered to resume the homeward journey, I got up and walked \non till I left the army (camp) behind. When I had answered the call of nature, I went towards my \nhowdah, but behold ! A necklace of mine made of Jaz Azfar (a kind of black bead) was broken and I \nlooked for it and my search for it detained me. \nThe group of people who used to carry me, came and carried my howdah on to the back of my camel \non which I was riding, considering that I was therein. At that time women were light in weight and \nwere not fleshy for they used to eat little (food), so those people did not feel the lightness of the \nhowdah while raising it up, and I was still a young lady. They drove away the camel and proceeded. \nThen I found my necklace after the army had gone. I came to their camp but found nobody therein so I \nwent to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back in my search. \nWhile I was sitting at my place, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Al-Mu'attil As-Sulami Adh- \nDhakw-ani was behind the army. He had started in the last part of the night and reached my stationing \nplace in the morning and saw the figure of a sleeping person. He came to me and recognized me on \nseeing me for he used to see me before veiling. I got up because of his saying: \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna \nilaihi rajiun,\" which he uttered on recognizing me. I covered my face with my garment, and by Allah, \nhe did not say to me a single word except, \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" till he made his shecamel \nkneel down whereupon he trod on its forelegs and I mounted it. Then Safwan set out, leading \nthe she-camel that was carrying me, till we met the army while they were resting during the hot \nmidday. \nThen whoever was meant for destruction, fell in destruction, and the leader of the Ifk (forged \nstatement) was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After this we arrived at Medina and I became ill for one \nmonth while the people were spreading the forged statements of the people of the Ifk, and I was not \naware of anything thereof. But what aroused my doubt while I was sick, was that I was no longer \nreceiving from Allah's Messenger () the same kindness as I used to receive when I fell sick. Allah's Messenger () \nwould enter upon me, say a greeting and add, \"How is that (lady)?\" and then depart. \nThat aroused my suspicion but I was not aware of the propagated evil till I recovered from my \nailment. I went out with Um Mistah to answer the call of nature towards Al-Manasi, the place where \nwe used to relieve ourselves, and used not to go out for this purpose except from night to night, and \nthat was before we had lavatories close to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit \nof the old 'Arabs (in the deserts or in the tents) concerning the evacuation of the bowels, for we \nconsidered it troublesome and harmful to take lavatories in the houses. So I went out with Um Mistah \nwho was the daughter of Abi Ruhm bin `Abd Manaf, and her mother was daughter of Sakhr bin Amir \nwho was the aunt of Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, and her son was Mistah bin Uthatha. When we had finished \nour affair, Um Mistah and I came back towards my house. Um Mistah stumbled over her robe \nwhereupon she said, \"Let Mistah be ruined ! \" I said to her, \"What a bad word you have said! Do you \nabuse a man who has taken part in the Battle of Badr?' She said, \"O you there! Didn't you hear what \nhe has said?\" I said, \"And what did he say?\" She then told me the statement of the people of the Ifk \n(forged statement) which added to my ailment. When I returned home, Allah's Messenger () came to me, \nand after greeting, he said, \"How is that (lady)?\" I said, \"Will you allow me to go to my parents?\" At \nthat time I intended to be sure of the news through them. Allah's Messenger () allowed me and I went to my \nparents and asked my mother, \"O my mother! What are the people talking about?\" My mother said, \n\"O my daughter! Take it easy, for by Allah, there is no charming lady who is loved by her husband \nwho has other wives as well, but that those wives would find fault with her.\" I said, \"Subhan Allah! \nDid the people really talk about that?\" \nThat night I kept on weeping the whole night till the morning. My tears never stopped, nor did I sleep, \nand morning broke while I was still weeping, Allah's Messenger () called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin \nZaid when the Divine Inspiration delayed, in order to consult them as to the idea of divorcing his wife. \nUsama bin Zaid told Allah's Messenger () of what he knew about the innocence of his wife and of his \naffection he kept for her. He said, \"O Allah's Messenger ()! She is your wife, and we do not know anything \nabout her except good.\" But `Ali bin Abi Talib said, \"O Allah's Messenger ()! Allah does not impose \nrestrictions on you; and there are plenty of women other than her. If you however, ask (her) slave girl, \nshe will tell you the truth.\" `Aisha added: So Allah's Messenger () called for Barira and said, \"O Barira! Did \nyou ever see anything which might have aroused your suspicion? (as regards Aisha). Barira said, \"By \nAllah Who has sent you with the truth, I have never seen anything regarding Aisha which I would \nblame her for except that she is a girl of immature age who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough of \nher family unprotected so that the domestic goats come and eat it.\" \nSo Allah's Messenger () got up (and addressed) the people an asked for somebody who would take revenge \non `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul then. Allah's Messenger (), while on the pulpit, said, \"O Muslims! Who \nwill help me against a man who has hurt me by slandering my family? By Allah, I know nothing \nexcept good about my family, and people have blamed a man of whom I know nothing except good, \nand he never used to visit my family except with me,\" Sa`d bin Mu`adh Al-Ansari got up and said, \"O \nAllah's Messenger ()! By Allah, I will relieve you from him. If he be from the tribe of (Bani) Al-Aus, then I \nwill chop his head off; and if he be from our brethren, the Khazraj, then you give us your order and we \nwill obey it.\" \nOn that, Sa`d bin 'Ubada got up, and he was the chief of the Khazraj, and before this incident he had \nbeen a pious man but he was incited by his zeal for his tribe. He said to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh), \"By Allah \nthe Eternal, you have told a lie! You shall not kill him and you will never be able to kill him!\" On that, \nUsaid bin Hudair, the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin 'Ubada, \"You are a liar! \nBy Allah the Eternal, we will surely kill him; and you are a hypocrite defending the hypocrites!\" So \nthe two tribes of Al-Aus and Al-Khazraj got excited till they were on the point of fighting with each \nother while Allah's Messenger () was standing on the pulpit. Allah's Messenger () continued quietening them till \nthey became silent whereupon he became silent too. On that day I kept on weeping so much that \nneither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me, and I had wept \nfor two nights and a day without sleeping and with incessant tears till they thought that my liver would \nburst with weeping. While they were with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked permission \nto see me. I admitted her and she sat and started weeping with me. While I was in that state, Allah's \nApostle came to us, greeted, and sat down,. He had never sat with me since the day what was said, \nwas said. He had stayed a month without receiving any Divine Inspiration concerning my case. \nAllah's Messenger () recited the Tashahhud after he had sat down, and then said, \"Thereafter, O `Aisha! I \nhave been informed such and-such a thing about you; and if you are innocent, Allah will reveal your \ninnocence, and if you have committed a sin, then ask for Allah's forgiveness and repent to Him, for \nwhen a slave confesses his sin and then repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance.\" When Allah's \nApostle had finished his speech, my tears ceased completely so that I no longer felt even a drop \nthereof. Then I said to my father, \"Reply to Allah's Messenger () on my behalf as to what he said.\" He said, \n\"By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah's Messenger ().\" Then I said to my mother, \"Reply to Allah's \nApostle.\" \nShe said, \"I do not know what to say to Allah's Messenger ().\" Still a young girl as I was and though I had \nlittle knowledge of Qur'an, I said, \"By Allah, I know that you heard this story (of the Ifk) so much so \nthat it has been planted in your minds and you have believed it. So now, if I tell you that I am \ninnocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will not believe me; and if I confess something, \nand Allah knows that I am innocent of it, you will believe me. By Allah, I cannot find of you an \nexample except that of Joseph's father: \"So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you \nassert and it is Allah (Alone) Whose help can be sought. Then I turned away and lay on my bed, and \nat that time I knew that I was innocent and that Allah would reveal my innocence. But by Allah, I \nnever thought that Allah would sent down about my affair, Divine Inspiration that would be recited \n(forever), as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something that was to be \nrecited: but I hoped that Allah's Messenger () might have a vision in which Allah would prove my \ninnocence. By Allah, Allah's Messenger () had not left his seat and nobody had left the house when the \nDivine Inspiration came to Allah's Messenger () . So there overtook him the same hard condition which \nused to overtake him (when he was Divinely Inspired) so that the drops of his sweat were running \ndown, like pearls, though it was a (cold) winter day, and that was because of the heaviness of the \nStatement which was revealed to him. When that state of Allah's Messenger () was over, and he was \nsmiling when he was relieved, the first word he said was, \"Aisha, Allah has declared your innocence.\" \nMy mother said to me, \"Get up and go to him.\" I said, \"By Allah, I will not go to him and I will not \nthank anybody but Allah.\" So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the Slander are a gang among \nyou. Think it not....\" (24.11-20). \nWhen Allah revealed this to confirm my innocence, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to provide for \nMistah bin Uthatha because of the latter's kinship to him and his poverty, said, \"By Allah, I will never \nprovide for Mistah anything after what he has said about Aisha\". So Allah revealed: \n(continued...) \n(continuing... 1): -6.274:... ... \n\"Let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not to give (help) to their kinsmen, \nthose in need, and those who have left their homes for Allah's Cause. Let them Pardon and forgive \n(i.e. do not punish them). Do you not love that should forgive you? Verily Allah is Oft-forgiving. \nMost Merciful.\" (24.22) \nAbu Bakr said, \"Yes, by Allah, I wish that Allah should forgive me.\" So he resumed giving Mistah the \naid he used to give him before and said, \"By Allah, I will never withold it from him at all.\" Aisha \nfurther said: Allah's Messenger () also asked Zainab bint Jahsh about my case. He said, \"O Zainab! What \nhave you seen?\" She replied, \"O Allah's Messenger ()! I protect my hearing and my sight (by refraining \nfrom telling lies). I know nothing but good (about Aisha).\" Of all the wives of Allah's Messenger (), it was \nZainab who aspired to receive from him the same favor as I used to receive, yet, Allah saved her \n(from telling lies) because of her piety. But her sister, Hamna, kept on fighting on her behalf so she \nwas destroyed as were those who invented and spread the slander.", "4561": "\nNarrated Um Ruman:\nAisha's mother, When `Aisha was accused, she fell down Unconscious.", "4562": "\nNarrated Ibn Abi Mulaika:\nI heard `Aisha reciting: \"When you invented a lie (and carry it) on your tongues.\" (24.15)", "4563": "\nNarrated Ibn Abu Mulaika:\nIbn `Abbas asked permission to visit Aisha before her death, and at that time she was in a state of \nagony. She then said. \"I am afraid that he will praise me too much.\" And then it was said to her, \"He is \nthe cousin of Allah's Messenger () and one of the prominent Muslims.\" Then she said, \"Allow him to \nenter.\" (When he entered) he said, \"How are you?\" She replied, \"I am Alright if I fear (Allah).\" Ibn \n`Abbas said, \"Allah willing, you are Alright as you are the wife of Allah's Messenger () and he did not \nmarry any virgin except you and proof of your innocence was revealed from the Heaven.\" Later on \nIbn Az-Zubair entered after him and `Aisha said to him, \"Ibn `Abbas came to me and praised me \ngreatly, but I wish that I was a thing forgotten and out of sight.\"", "4564": "\nNarrated Al-Qasim:\nIbn `Abbas asked `Aisha's permission to enter.

Thereupon Hassan said the following poetic verse: \n\"A chaste pious woman who arouses no suspicion. She never talks about chaste heedless women \nbehind their backs.' On that she said, \"But you are not so.\"", "4566": "\nNarrated Masruq:\nHassan came to Aisha and said the following poetic Verse: 'A chaste pious woman who arouses no \nsuspicion.

By Allah, I do not know anything bad about her. By Allah, they accused \r\nher of being with a man about whom I have never known anything bad, and he never entered my \r\nhouse unless I was present there, and whenever I went on a journey, he went with me.\" Sa`d bin \r\nMu`adh got up and said, \"O Allah's Messenger () Allow me to chop their heads off\". \r\nThen a man from the Al-Khazraj (Sa`d bin 'Ubada) to whom the mother of (the poet) Hassan bin \r\nThabit was a relative, got up and said (to Sa`d bin Mu`adh), \"You have told a lie! By Allah, if those \r\npersons were from the Aus Tribe, you would not like to chop their heads off.\" It was probable that \r\nsome evil would take place between the Aus and the Khazraj in the mosque, and I was unaware of all \r\nthat. In the evening of that day, I went out for some of my needs (i.e. to relieve myself), and Um \r\nMistah was accompanying me. \r\nOn our return, Um Mistah stumbled and said, \"Let Mistah. be ruined\" I said to her, \"O mother Why do \r\nyou abuse your Son\" On that Um Mistah became silent for a while, and stumbling again, she said, \r\n\"Let Mistah be ruined\" I said to her, \"Why do you abuse your son?\" She stumbled for the third time \r\nand said, \"Let Mistah be ruined\" whereupon I rebuked her for that. She said, \"By Allah, I do not abuse \r\nhim except because of you.\" I asked her, \"Concerning what of my affairs?\" So she disclosed the whole \r\nstory to me. I said, \"Has this really happened?\" She replied, \"Yes, by Allah.\" I returned to my house, \r\nastonished (and distressed) that I did not know for what purpose I had gone out. \r\nThen I became sick (fever) and said to Allah's Messenger () \"Send me to my father's house.\" So he sent a \r\nslave with me, and when I entered the house, I found Um Rum-an (my mother) downstairs while (my \r\nfather) Abu Bakr was reciting something upstairs. My mother asked, \"What has brought you, O (my) \r\ndaughter?\" I informed her and mentioned to her the whole story, but she did not feel it as I did. She \r\nsaid, \"O my daughter! Take it easy, for there is never a charming lady loved by her husband who has \r\nother wives but that they feel jealous of her and speak badly of her.\" But she did not feel the news as I \r\ndid. I asked (her), \"Does my father know about it?\" She said, \"yes\" I asked, Does Allah's Messenger () \r\nknow about it too?\" She said, \"Yes, Allah's Messenger () does too.\" So the tears filled my eyes and I wept. \r\nAbu Bakr, who was reading upstairs heard my voice and came down and asked my mother, \"What is \r\nthe matter with her? \" She said, \"She has heard what has been said about her (as regards the story of \r\nAl-lfk).\" On that Abu- Bakr wept and said, \"I beseech you by Allah, O my daughter, to go back to \r\nyour home\". \r\nI went back to my home and Allah's Messenger () had come to my house and asked my maid-servant about \r\nme (my character). The maid-servant said, \"By Allah, I do not know of any defect in her character \r\nexcept that she sleeps and let the sheep enter (her house) and eat her dough.\" On that, some of the \r\nProphet's companions spoke harshly to her and said, \"Tell the truth to Allah's Messenger ().\" Finally they \r\ntold her of the affair (of the slander). She said, \"Subhan Allah! By Allah, I know nothing against her \r\nexcept what goldsmith knows about a piece of pure gold.\" Then this news reached the man who was \r\naccused, and he said, \"Subhan Allah! By Allah, I have never uncovered the private parts of any \r\nwoman.\" Later that man was martyred in Allah's Cause. \r\nNext morning my parents came to pay me a visit and they stayed with me till Allah's Messenger () came to \r\nme after he had offered the `Asr prayer. He came to me while my parents were sitting around me on \r\nmy right and my left. He praised and glorified Allah and said, \"Now then O `Aisha! If you have \r\ncommitted a bad deed or you have wronged (yourself), then repent to Allah as Allah accepts the \r\nrepentance from his slaves.\" An Al-Ansari woman had come and was sitting near the gate. I said (to \r\nthe Prophet). \"Isn't it improper that you speak in such a way in the presence of this lady? Allah's \r\nApostle then gave a piece of advice and I turned to my father and requested him to answer him (on my \r\nbehalf). My father said, \"What should I say?\" Then I turned to my mother and asked her to answer \r\nhim. She said, \"What should I say?\" When my parents did not give a reply to the Prophet, I said, \"I \r\ntestify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah, and that Muhammad is His Apostle!\" \r\nAnd after praising and glorifying Allah as He deserves, I said, \"Now then, by Allah, if I were to tell \r\nyou that I have not done (this evil action) and Allah is a witness that I am telling the truth, that would \r\nnot be of any use to me on your part because you (people) have spoken about it and your hearts have \r\nabsorbed it; and if I were to tell you that I have done this sin and Allah knows that I have not done it, \r\nthen you will say, 'She has confessed herself guilty.\" By Allah, 'I do not see a suitable example for me \r\nand you but the example of (I tried to remember Jacob's name but couldn't) Joseph's father when he \r\nsaid; So (for me) \"Patience is most fitting against that which you assert. It is Allah (alone) whose help \r\ncan be sought.' \r\nAt that very hour the Divine Inspiration came to Allah's Messenger () and we remained silent. Then the \r\nInspiration was over and I noticed the signs of happiness on his face while he was removing (the \r\nsweat) from his forehead and saying, \"Have the good tidings O ' \"Aisha! Allah has revealed your \r\ninnocence.\" At that time I was extremely angry. My parents said to me. \"Get up and go to him.\" I said, \r\n\"By Allah, I will not do it and will not thank him nor thank either of you, but I will thank Allah Who \r\nhas revealed my innocence. You have heard this story but neither did not deny it nor change it (to \r\ndefend me),\" (Aisha used to say:) \"But as regards Zainab bint Jahsh, (the Prophet's wife), Allah \r\nprotected her because of her piety, so she did not say anything except good (about me), but her sister, \r\nHamna, was ruined among those who were ruined. Those who used to speak evil about me were \r\nMistah, Hassan bin Thabit, and the hypocrite, `Abdullah bin Ubai, who used to spread that news and \r\ntempt others to speak of it, and it was he and Hamna who had the greater share therein. Abu Bakr took \r\nan oath that he would never do any favor to Mistah at all. Then Allah revealed the Divine Verse: \r\n\"Let not those among you who are good and wealthy (i.e. Abu Bakr) swear not to give (any sort of \r\nhelp) to their kinsmen, and those in need, (i.e. Mistah) ...Do you not love that Allah should forgive \r\nyou? And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) \r\nOn that, Abu Bakr said, \"Yes, by Allah, O our Lord!

One type was similar to that of the present day i.e. a man used to ask somebody else for the hand of a girl under his guardianship or for his daughter's hand, and give her Mahr and then marry her. The second type was that a man would say to his wife after she had become clean from her period. \"Send for so-and-so and have sexual intercourse with him.\" Her husband would then keep awy from her and would never sleep with her till she got pregnant from the other man with whom she was sleeping. When her pregnancy became evident, he husband would sleep with her if he wished. Her husband did so (i.e. let his wife sleep with some other man) so that he might have a child of noble breed. Such marriage was called as Al-Istibda'. Another type of marriage was that a group of less than ten men would assemble and enter upon a woman, and all of them would have sexual relation with her. If she became pregnant and delivered a child and some days had passed after delivery, she would sent for all of them and none of them would refuse to come, and when they all gathered before her, she would say to them, \"You (all) know waht you have done, and now I have given birth to a child. So, it is your child so-and-so!\" naming whoever she liked, and her child would follow him and he could not refuse to take him. The fourth type of marriage was that many people would enter upon a lady and she would never refuse anyone who came to her. Those were the prostitutes who used to fix flags at their doors as sign, and he who would wished, could have sexual intercourse with them. If anyone of them got pregnant and delivered a child, then all those men would be gathered for her and they would call the Qa'if (persons skilled in recognizing the likeness of a child to his father) to them and would let the child follow the man (whom they recognized as his father) and she would let him adhere to him and be called his son.

While I was in his house at Mina, and he was with `Umar bin Al-Khattab \nduring `Umar's last Hajj, `Abdur-Rahman came to me and said, \"Would that you had seen the man \nwho came today to the Chief of the Believers (`Umar), saying, 'O Chief of the Believers! What do you \nthink about so-and-so who says, 'If `Umar should die, I will give the pledge of allegiance to such-andsuch \nperson, as by Allah, the pledge of allegiance to Abu Bakr was nothing but a prompt sudden \naction which got established afterwards.' `Umar became angry and then said, 'Allah willing, I will \nstand before the people tonight and warn them against those people who want to deprive the others of \ntheir rights (the question of rulership). \n`Abdur-Rahman said, \"I said, 'O Chief of the believers! Do not do that, for the season of Hajj gathers \nthe riff-raff and the rubble, and it will be they who will gather around you when you stand to address \nthe people. And I am afraid that you will get up and say something, and some people will spread your \nstatement and may not say what you have actually said and may not understand its meaning, and may \ninterpret it incorrectly, so you should wait till you reach Medina, as it is the place of emigration and \nthe place of Prophet's Traditions, and there you can come in touch with the learned and noble people, \nand tell them your ideas with confidence; and the learned people will understand your statement and \nput it in its proper place.' On that, `Umar said, 'By Allah! Allah willing, I will do this in the first \nspeech I will deliver before the people in Medina.\" \nIbn `Abbas added: We reached Medina by the end of the month of Dhul-Hijja, and when it was \nFriday, we went quickly (to the mosque) as soon as the sun had declined, and I saw Sa`id bin Zaid bin \n`Amr bin Nufail sitting at the corner of the pulpit, and I too sat close to him so that my knee was \ntouching his knee, and after a short while `Umar bin Al-Khattab came out, and when I saw him \ncoming towards us, I said to Sa`id bin Zaid bin `Amr bin Nufail \"Today `Umar will say such a thing \nas he has never said since he was chosen as Caliph.\" Sa`id denied my statement with astonishment and \nsaid, \"What thing do you expect `Umar to say the like of which he has never said before?\" \nIn the meantime, `Umar sat on the pulpit and when the callmakers for the prayer had finished their \ncall, `Umar stood up, and having glorified and praised Allah as He deserved, he said, \"Now then, I am \ngoing to tell you something which (Allah) has written for me to say. I do not know; perhaps it \nportends my death, so whoever understands and remembers it, must narrate it to the others wherever \nhis mount takes him, but if somebody is afraid that he does not understand it, then it is unlawful for \nhim to tell lies about me. Allah sent Muhammad with the Truth and revealed the Holy Book to him, \nand among what Allah revealed, was the Verse of the Rajam (the stoning of married person (male & \nfemale) who commits illegal sexual intercourse, and we did recite this Verse and understood and \nmemorized it. Allah's Messenger () did carry out the punishment of stoning and so did we after him. \nI am afraid that after a long time has passed, somebody will say, 'By Allah, we do not find the Verse \nof the Rajam in Allah's Book,' and thus they will go astray by leaving an obligation which Allah has \nrevealed. And the punishment of the Rajam is to be inflicted to any married person (male & female), \nwho commits illegal sexual intercourse, if the required evidence is available or there is conception or \nconfession. And then we used to recite among the Verses in Allah's Book: 'O people! Do not claim to \nbe the offspring of other than your fathers, as it is disbelief (unthankfulness) on your part that you \nclaim to be the offspring of other than your real father.' Then Allah's Messenger () said, 'Do not praise me \nexcessively as Jesus, son of Marry was praised, but call me Allah's Slave and His Apostles.' (O \npeople!) I have been informed that a speaker amongst you says, 'By Allah, if `Umar should die, I will \ngive the pledge of allegiance to such-and-such person.' One should not deceive oneself by saying that \nthe pledge of allegiance given to Abu Bakr was given suddenly and it was successful. No doubt, it was \nlike that, but Allah saved (the people) from its evil, and there is none among you who has the qualities \nof Abu Bakr. Remember that whoever gives the pledge of allegiance to anybody among you without \nconsulting the other Muslims, neither that person, nor the person to whom the pledge of allegiance \nwas given, are to be supported, lest they both should be killed. \nAnd no doubt after the death of the Prophet () we were informed that the Ansar disagreed with us and \ngathered in the shed of Bani Sa`da. `Ali and Zubair and whoever was with them, opposed us, while \nthe emigrants gathered with Abu Bakr. I said to Abu Bakr, 'Let's go to these Ansari brothers of ours.' \nSo we set out seeking them, and when we approached them, two pious men of theirs met us and \ninformed us of the final decision of the Ansar, and said, 'O group of Muhajirin (emigrants) ! Where \nare you going?' We replied, 'We are going to these Ansari brothers of ours.' They said to us, 'You \nshouldn't go near them. Carry out whatever we have already decided.' I said, 'By Allah, we will go to \nthem.' And so we proceeded until we reached them at the shed of Bani Sa`da. Behold! There was a \nman sitting amongst them and wrapped in something. I asked, 'Who is that man?' They said, 'He is \nSa`d bin 'Ubada.' I asked, 'What is wrong with him?' They said, 'He is sick.' After we sat for a while, \nthe Ansar's speaker said, 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah,' and praising Allah as He \ndeserved, he added, 'To proceed, we are Allah's Ansar (helpers) and the majority of the Muslim army, \nwhile you, the emigrants, are a small group and some people among you came with the intention of \npreventing us from practicing this matter (of caliphate) and depriving us of it.' \nWhen the speaker had finished, I intended to speak as I had prepared a speech which I liked and which \nI wanted to deliver in the presence of Abu Bakr, and I used to avoid provoking him. So, when I \nwanted to speak, Abu Bakr said, 'Wait a while.' I disliked to make him angry. So Abu Bakr himself \ngave a speech, and he was wiser and more patient than I. By Allah, he never missed a sentence that I \nliked in my own prepared speech, but he said the like of it or better than it spontaneously. After a \npause he said, 'O Ansar! You deserve all (the qualities that you have attributed to yourselves, but this \nquestion (of Caliphate) is only for the Quraish as they are the best of the Arabs as regards descent and \nhome, and I am pleased to suggest that you choose either of these two men, so take the oath of \nallegiance to either of them as you wish. And then Abu Bakr held my hand and Abu Ubaida bin \nal-Jarrah's hand who was sitting amongst us. I hated nothing of what he had said except that \nproposal, for by Allah, I would rather have my neck chopped off as expiator for a sin than become the \nruler of a nation, one of whose members is Abu Bakr, unless at the time of my death my own-self \nsuggests something I don't feel at present.' \nAnd then one of the Ansar said, 'I am the pillar on which the camel with a skin disease (eczema) rubs \nitself to satisfy the itching (i.e., I am a noble), and I am as a high class palm tree! O Quraish. There \nshould be one ruler from us and one from you.' \nThen there was a hue and cry among the gathering and their voices rose so that I was afraid there \nmight be great disagreement, so I said, 'O Abu Bakr! Hold your hand out.' He held his hand out and I \npledged allegiance to him, and then all the emigrants gave the Pledge of allegiance and so did the \nAnsar afterwards. And so we became victorious over Sa`d bin Ubada (whom Al-Ansar wanted to \nmake a ruler). One of the Ansar said, 'You have killed Sa`d bin Ubada.' I replied, 'Allah has killed \nSa`d bin Ubada.' `Umar added, \"By Allah, apart from the great tragedy that had happened to us (i.e. \nthe death of the Prophet), there was no greater problem than the allegiance pledged to Abu Bakr \nbecause we were afraid that if we left the people, they might give the Pledge of allegiance after us to \none of their men, in which case we would have given them our consent for something against our real \nwish, or would have opposed them and caused great trouble. So if any person gives the Pledge of \nallegiance to somebody (to become a Caliph) without consulting the other Muslims, then the one he \nhas selected should not be granted allegiance, lest both of them should be killed.\"", "6606": "\nNarrated Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani:\nI heard the Prophet () ordering that an unmarried person guilty of illegal sexual intercourse be flogged \none-hundred stripes and be exiled for one year. `Umar bin Al-Khattab also exiled such a person, and \nthis tradition is still valid.", "6607": "\nNarrated Abu Huraira:\nAllah's Messenger () judged that the unmarried person who was guilty of illegal sexual intercourse be \nexiled for one year and receive the legal punishment (i.e., be flogged with one-hundred stripes) .", "6608": "\nNarrated Ibn `Abbas:\nThe Prophet () cursed the effeminate men and those women who assume the similitude (manners) of \nmen.
